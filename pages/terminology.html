				<h2>GM</h2>
				<h3>Game Master</h3>
				<p>This is the person organizing the game. Generally speaking, the GM is in charge of driving the story and 
					making decision about in-game events, particularly where the rules are not clearly defined.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="Item-Card">
				<h2>PC</h2>
				<h3>Player Character</h3>
				<p>These are the characters our players play. Always remember that - even though we are roleplaying make-belief - there 
					is a real person with real feelings behind the character.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="Item-Card">
				<h2>NPC</h2>
				<h3>Non-Player Character</h3>
				<p>These are the characters the GM plays. They may be shopkeepers, passers-by, or enemies, and are typically only
					played (or even created) as the PCs meet and interact with them.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="Item-Card">
				<h2>BBEG</h2>
				<h3>Big Bad Evil Guy</h3>
				<p>A final boss-type character which the PCs fight, usually met near the end of a campaign, 
					or at the culmination of a significant story arc.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="Item-Card">
				<h2>Lv</h2>
				<h3>Level</h3>
				<p>A level is a general measure of strength. Character levels start at 1, and while there is no theoretical upper limit, 
					it is very uncommon to move past Lv20.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="Item-Card">
				<h2>HP</h2>
				<h3>Health Points</h3>
				<p>A representation of PC durability. The more HP you have, the longer you can stay in dangerous situations without 
					falling.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="Item-Card">
				<h2>MP</h2>
				<h3>Mana Points</h3>
				<p>Mana is used to perform spells and other abilities. Such abilities are usually significantly stronger than basic 
					(non-Mana) abilities.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="Item-Card">
				<h2>AP</h2>
				<h3>Attribute Points</h3>
				<p>Attributes are numerical descriptors of a character's capabilities. There are 6 attributes: Constitution, Strength, 
					Dexterity, Intelligence, Wisdom and Charisma.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="Item-Card">
				<h2>CON</h2>
				<h3>Constitution</h3>
				<p>Constitution refers to a character's physical resilience. It directly affects maxHP, 
					physical Resistance (PR), as well as their Endurance and Resistance ability rolls.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="Item-Card">
				<h2>STR</h2>
				<h3>Strength</h3>
				<p>Strength is a mesaure of a character's ability to apply brute force using their body. It also directly increases 
					Melee Damage (MD), as well as Athletics, Grappling and Intimidation ability rolls.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="Item-Card">
				<h2>DEX</h2>
				<h3>Dexterity</h3>
				<p>Dexterity could also be called agility. It affects a character's ability to dodge incoming attacks (DV), 
					as well as Acrobatics, Reflex, Stealth and Thievery ability rolls.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="Item-Card">
				<h2>INT</h2>
				<h3>Intelligence</h3>
				<p>Intelligence refers to a character's resourcefulness. It directly affects maxMana, as well as the ability rolls 
					for Crafting, History, Investigation and Mindfulness rolls.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="Item-Card">
				<h2>WIS</h2>
				<h3>Wisdom</h3>
				<p>Wisdom is a measure of how in-tune a character is with their surroundings, including the winds of magic. 
					Ability rolls in this category are Intuition, Perception, Survival and Willpower.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="Item-Card">
				<h2>CHA</h2>
				<h3>Charisma</h3>
				<p>Charisma is the art of wordplay and acting. It is the most influential role-play attribute for non-combat 
					encounters, and also affects Inspiration, Leadership, Performance and Persuasion Rolls.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="Item-Card">
				<h2>BP</h2>
				<h3>Background Points</h3>
				<p>BP are powerful points that very heavily influence how your PC plays. They are rare and should be spent very 
					deliberately. These points allow almost limitless customizability for your PCs.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="Item-Card">
				<h2>SP</h2>
				<h3>Skill Points</h3>
				<p>Skill Points are relatively more common and less powerful points, but still allow high player freedom in 
					their PC creation. Please refer to the <a href="./skillcreation.html">Skill Creation Guide</a> when creating 
					these.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="Item-Card">
				<h2>PP</h2>
				<h3>Participation Points</h3>
				<p>PP are a player currency to help out their character with critical rolls through Inspiration bonuses. Despite 
					the fact that they are a player currency, they are PC specific and non-transferrable.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="Item-Card">
				<h2>DV</h2>
				<h3>Dodge Value</h3>
				<p>DV represents a PCs ability to dodge incoming attacks completely. Due to the significance of this stat, 
					it has far more limiting rules regarding BP/SP modifications.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="Item-Card">
				<h2>DC</h2>
				<h3>Difficult Class</h3>
				<p>In some cases, an attack cannot reasonably be dodged entirely, or may be at least partially resisted even though
					it was not dodged. In these cases, characters must make a saving roll against a DC number.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="Item-Card">
				<h2>atk</h2>
				<h3>Attack Roll</h3>
				<p>When a character makes an attack action, they roll one 20 sided die (1d20). After adding appropriate modifiers, 
					the result of this roll represents the atk value.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="Item-Card">
				<h2>dmg</h2>
				<h3>Damage Roll</h3>
				<p>After making the atk roll, the character has to determine the damage output of their attack action. Modifiers 
					for this roll are quite common, especially for melee attacks.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="Item-Card">
				<h2>MD</h2>
				<h3>Melee Damage</h3>
				<p>This is a universal melee damage modifier. All melee attacks gain the MD bonus, even if a character has spent no 
					points (BP/SP) into melee damage skills, and negative modifiers are ignored.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="Item-Card">
				<h2>PR</h2>
				<h3>Physical Resistance</h3>
				<p>PR reduces the damage of incoming physical attacks (pdmg - PR => actual H loss). Positive CON modifiers automatically 
					increase PR, in addition to skill and item bonuses.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="Item-Card">
				<h2>MR</h2>
				<h3>Magical Resistance</h3>
				<p>MR reduces the damage of incoming magical attacks (mdmg - PR => actual H loss). Positive WIS modifiers automatically
				increase MR, in addition to skill and item bonuses.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="Item-Card">
				<h2>AOO</h2>
				<h3>Attack of Opportunity</h3>
				<p>AOOs represent zone of control. If an enemy leaves a character's melee range, the character that did not move may 
					use a Reaction to perform an attack action (no Mana abilities though).</p>
