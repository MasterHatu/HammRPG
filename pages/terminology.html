				<h1>GM</h1>
				<h2>Game Master</h2>
				<p>This is the person organizing the game. Generally speaking, the GM is in charge of making decision about 
					in-game events as they relate to situations where the game rules are not clearly defined.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="Item-Card">
				<h1>PC</h1>
				<h2>Player Character</h2>
				<p>These are the characters our players play. Always remember that - even though we are roleplaying make-belief - there 
					is a real person with real feelings behind the character.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="Item-Card">
				<h1>NPC</h1>
				<h2>Non-Player Character</h2>
				<p>These are the characters the GM plays. They may be shopkeepers, passers-by, or enemies, and are typically only
					played (or even created) as the PCs meet and interact with them.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="Item-Card">
				<h1>BBEG</h1>
				<h2>Big Bad Evil Guy</h2>
				<p>A final boss-type character which the PCs fight, usually met near the end of a campaign, 
					or at the culmination of a significant story arc.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="Item-Card">
				<h1>Lv</h1>
				<h2>Level</h2>
				<p>A level is a general measure of strength. Character levels start at 1, and while there is no theoretical upper limit, 
					it is very uncommon to move past Lv20.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="Item-Card">
				<h1>HP</h1>
				<h2>Health Points</h2>
				<p>A representation of PC durability. The more HP you have, the longer you can stay in dangerous situations without 
					falling.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="Item-Card">
				<h1>MP</h1>
				<h2>Mana Points</h2>
				<p>Mana is used to perform spells and other abilities. Such abilities are usually significantly stronger than basic 
					(non-Mana) abilities.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="Item-Card">
				<h1>AP</h1>
				<h2>Attribute Points</h2>
				<p>Attributes are numerical descriptors of a character's capabilities. There are 6 attributes: Constitution, Strength, 
					Dexterity, Intelligence, Wisdom and Charisma.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="Item-Card">
				<h1>CON</h1>
				<h2>Constitution</h2>
				<p>Constitution refers to a character's physical resilience. It directly affects maxHP, 
					physical Resistance (PR), as well as their Endurance and Resistance ability rolls.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="Item-Card">
				<h1>STR</h1>
				<h2>Strength</h2>
				<p>Strength is a mesaure of a character's ability to apply brute force using their body. It also directly increases 
					Melee Damage (MD), as well as Athletics, Grappling and Intimidation ability rolls.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="Item-Card">
				<h1>DEX</h1>
				<h2>Dexterity</h2>
				<p>Dexterity could also be called agility. It affects a character's ability to dodge incoming attacks (DV), 
					as well as Acrobatics, Reflex, Stealth and Thievery ability rolls.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="Item-Card">
				<h1>INT</h1>
				<h2>Intelligence</h2>
				<p>Intelligence refers to a character's resourcefulness. It directly affects maxMana, as well as the ability rolls 
					for Crafting, History, Investigation and Mindfulness rolls.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="Item-Card">
				<h1>WIS</h1>
				<h2>Wisdom</h2>
				<p>Wisdom is a measure of how in-tune a character is with their surroundings, including the winds of magic. 
					Ability rolls in this category are Intuition, Perception, Survival and Willpower.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="Item-Card">
				<h1>CHA</h1>
				<h2>Charisma</h2>
				<p>Charisma is the art of wordplay and acting. It is the most influential role-play attribute for non-combat 
					encounters, and also affects Inspiration, Leadership, Performance and Persuasion Rolls.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="Item-Card">
				<h1>BP</h1>
				<h2>Background Points</h2>
				<p>BP are powerful points that very heavily influence how your PC plays. They are rare and should be spent very 
					deliberately. These points allow almost limitless customizability for your PCs.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="Item-Card">
				<h1>SP</h1>
				<h2>Skill Points</h2>
				<p>Skill Points are relatively more common and less powerful points, but still allow high player freedom in 
					their PC creation. Please refer to the <a href="./abilities.html">ability</a> guide when creating these.</p>
