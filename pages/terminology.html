        <h3>GM</h3>
        <h6>Game Master</h6>
        <p>GM refers to the person organizing the game. Generally speaking, this is the person in charge of making decision about 
          in-game events as they relate to situations where the game rules are not clearly defined. Anyone can do this, but having more 
          game experience certainly makes this easier</p>

        <h3>PC</h3>
        <h6>Player Character</h6>
        <p>These are the characters within the stories we play. Always remember that - even though we are roleplaying make-belief - there 
          is a real person with real feelings behind the character.</p>
