				<h1 id="Attributes">Attributes</h1>
					<p>HammRPG uses six common attributes to define a character's general affinity with certain abilities: 
						Constitution (CON), Strength (STR), Dexterity (DEX), Intelligence (INT), Wisdom (WIS) and Charisma (CHA).</p>
					<p>Attributes are used in two different ways:</p>
					<ol>
						<li>The attribute value itself.</li>
						<li>An ability modifier based on that attribute.</li>
					</ol>
					<p>For all attributes, HammRPG uses the full name (e.g.: Constitution) when referring to the attribute 
						itself, while we use use the abbreviation (e.g.: CON) when referring to the modifier.</p>

					<h2 id="AP-Distribution">Attribute Point Distribution</h2>
						<p>There are various ways to allocate Attribute Points (AP) in your specific game. Which system you use should 
							be discussed during the <a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="scrolltoSection('Session-Zero')">Session 
							Zero</a> before you actually start playing.</p>
						<p>The main method of attribute point distribution endorsed by HammRPG is sometimes called Point-Buy: All 
							characters start with 60 Attribute Points (AP), and gain 1 additional AP per Lv. These points can be 
							allocated to any of the attributes entirely at the player's preference. This is the default method, as it 
							allows complete player freedon in their character creation, and results in characters that should be at 
							least reasonably similar in power compared to each other. Of course, in a game as customizable as HammRPG, 
							complete balance is nearly impossible, as one set of abilities might synergize better than another.</p>
						<p>Another popular method is Stat-Rolling: Each player rolls three six-sided dice (3d6) six times. The results 
							of the rolls are either appended to the attributes in order, or at the player's preference, per group 
							discussion. This method introduces an element of randomness, which can result in wildly different characters 
							strength levels. While experienced players may relish the challenge of adjusting their play-style according 
							to what character they rolled, newer players may find it more difficult, especially if they ended up with a 
							below average character. Additionally, most enemies in the <a href="./gm-guide.html">GM guide</a> are balanced 
							around the idea that characters will have a base of 60 AP.</p>
						<p>Note that AP (as well as most other types of points) can only be changed when the character is created, or 
							during level-up events, which usually require a full rest.</p>

				<h2 id="AP-Modifiers">Attribute Modifiers</h2>
					<p>Modifiers are calculated based on the attribute most relevant to the roll. An attribute score of 10 is 
						considered average, resulting in no modifiers to rolls based on that attribute. If a character has an 
						attribute score lower than 10, they will have a negative modifier to those rolls, while an attribute 
						higher than 10 will grant a bonus to those rolls.</p>
					<p>The formula for calculating your modifier is:</p>
					<div class="Highlight">
						<h2>modifier = ( attribute - 10 ) / 2</h2>
					</div>
					<p><b>Note:</b> Only integer values are valid for modifier calculations. A result of less than 1 is always <i>
							rounded down</i> to the nearest full number.</p>
					<p>E.g. if a character has an attribute value of 11, their modifier is (11-10)/2=0.5 => 0.</p>

				<h3 id="Constitution">Constitution</h3>
					<p>Constitution (CON) is a measure of a character's toughness, and their ability to withstand damage. The most 
						direct way to represent this is with the number of Health Points (HP) the character has:</p>
					<div class="Highlight">
						<h2>maxHP = Constitution * Lv</h2>
					</div>
					<p>Based on this formula, you can see that maxHP increases with higher values of Constitution, as well as 
						the character level itself. As such, a character with high Constitution will continue to gain larger amounts of 
						maxHP per level-up than one with low Constitution.</p>
					<p>Constitution also affects Physical Resistance (PR), which further helps your character withstand damage. The 
						PR modifier works the same as the regular CON modifier, except that it does not have negative values, even if 
						your Constitutionis less than 10.</p>
					<div class="Highlight">
						<article>
							<h5>If CON < 0:</h5>
							<h2>PR = 0</h2>
						</article>
						<article>
							<h5>If CON >= 0:</h5>
							<h2>PR = CON</h2>
						</article>
					</div>
					<p>Please refer to the damage calculation guide below for further details on PR.</p>
					<p>The Endurance and Resistance abilities are also based on Constitution.</p>
			</article>

				<h3 id="Strength">Strength</h3>
					<p>Strength (STR) is a measure of the physical force that a character can exert. One of its largest benefits is 
						its effect on Melee Damage (MD), which will cause your melee attacks to hit harder. Just as PR does not 
						have negative values, MD also does not decrease a damage roll's (dmg) result.</p>
					<div class="Highlight">
						<article>
							<h5>If STR < 0:</h5>
									<h2>MD = 0</h2>
						</article>
						<article>
							<h5>If STR >= 0:</h5>
							<h2>MD = STR</h2>
						</article>
					</div>
					<p>Please refer to the damage calculation guide below for further details on MD.</p>
					<p>Strength also affects the Athletics, Grappling and Intimidation abilities.</p>
			</article>
			
			<article>
				<h3 id="Dexterity">Dexterity</h3>
					<p>Dexterity (DEX) is a measure of agility and flexibility. A character with a high Dexterity attribute 
						is better able to perform jumps and other complicated maneuvers, avoid or disable traps, and may even 
						be able to dodge incoming attacks entirely.</p>
					<p>Dodge Value (DV), which allows characters to completely avoid attacks, is calculated similar to other 
						modifiers, however, it scales only half as rapidly:</p>
					<div class="Highlight">
						<h2>DV = ( DEX - 10 ) / 4</h2>
					</div>
					<p>It is important to note that DV does not make a character invulnerable: Area damage, such as an exploding 
						fireball, a cloud of poison, a collapsing wall, or a shockwave from an artillery shell, applies directly, 
						without any chance to dodge. In such cases, the GM may call for a Reflex or Resistance save to reduce the 
						damage, but DV itself will not come into play.</p>
					<p>Dexterity also affects the Acrobatics, Reflex, Stealth and Thievery abilities.</p>
			</article>

				<h3 id="Intelligence">Intelligence</h3>
					<p>Intelligence (INT) represents a character's ability to use their mind through their Mana Points (MP):</p>
					<div class="Highlight">
						<h2>maxMP = Intelligence * Lv</h2>
					</div>
					<p>As you can see, the formula is the same as the formula for maxHP, except instead of using Constitution as 
						a base, MP are based on INT. As MP are needed to use active abilities, this means that characters with a high 
						Intelligence attribute will be able to use their active abilities more often than those with low Intelligence.</p>
					<p>Intelligence also comes into play as a form of roleplay immersion. For instance, an NPC with a low Intelligence 
						attribute is less likely to use advanced combat tactics than one with high Intelligence. Many players also enjoy 
						roleplaying these details, as it creates a fun atmosphere for everyone.</p>
					<p>The abilities based on Intelligence focus more on roleplaying than on pure combat stats, through Crafting, 
						History, Investigation, and Mindfulness. However, a smart player can still use this attribute to create a powerful 
						character.</p>
					</p>
			</article>
			
			<article>
				<h3 id="Wisdom">Wisdom</h3>
					<p>Wisdom (WIS) represents a character's attunement with the world around them, including magic. Most magic based 
						abilities use the WIS modifier to enhance magical damage rolls, and a high Wisdom attribute also improves magical 
						reisitance (MR) to defend against enemy spells. The formula is very similar to that for PR:</p>
					<div class="Highlight">
						<article>
							<h5>If WIS < 0:</h5>
							<h2>MR = 0</h2>
						</article>
						<article>
							<h5>If WIS >= 0:</h5>
							<h2>MR = WIS</h2>
						</article>
					</div>
					<p>Therefore, a character with a Wisdom attribute of 12, would automatically have an MR value of +1. Please refer to 
						the damage calculation guide below for further details on MR.</p>
					<p>Wisdom further affects the ability rolls for Intuition, Perception, Survival and Willpower.</p>
			</article>
			
			<article>
				<h3 id="Charisma">Charisma</h3>
					<p>Charisma (CHA) is the attribute least applicable to combat, but that does not make it any weaker than the other 
						attributes. A character with high Charisma benefits from significant advantages during roleplay elements of a game, 
						including the potential to avoid combat altogether. Meanwhile, a character with a particularly low Charisma score 
						may find themselves unfortunately vulnerable to spells that affect the mind, which range from card tricks and other 
						small illusions to game-changing charms or mind-controls. Nevertheless, Charisma remains one of the subtler 
						attributes.</p>
					<p>Groups who do not enjoy the haggling experience in their games can also use the CHA modifier to quickly calculate 
						discounts when their characters visit merchants to purchase items:</p>
					<div class="Highlight">
						<article>
							<h5>When Purchasing:</h5>
							<h2><section>Purchase Price</section><section>=</section><section>Armory Price * ( 1.5 - ( CHA / 50 ) ) * Local 
								Supply Modifier</section></h2>
						</article>
						<article>
							<h5>When Selling:</h5>
							<h2><section>Selling Price</section><section>=</section><section>Armory Price * ( 0.5 + ( CHA / 50 ) ) * Local 
								Supply Modifier</section></h2>
						</article>
					</div>
					<p>The Inspiration, Leadership, Performance, and Persuasion abilities are based on Charisma.</p>
