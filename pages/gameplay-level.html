				<h1 id="Level">Character Level</h1>
					<p>Mathematically, the main measurement of advancement and power of a character is the character level (Lv).</p>
					<p>The lowest possible Lv is Lv1, and while theoretically there is no upper limit to Lv, the higher you go the 
						more complicated the game becomes. As the number of abilities continues to increase for both PCs and NPCs, it 
						becomes increasingly difficult to keep track of everything, and so, for practicality, we typically scale NPCs up to 
						approximately Lv20, as shown below (Note that this is only a rough guide, and many exceptions may exist at the 
						discretion of the GM.):</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Lv1 to Lv3 - Slaves, prisoners, and other characters that have been deliberately weakened</li>
						<li>Lv4 to Lv6 - Average citizens, grunt soldiers, or common animals</li>
						<li>Lv7 to Lv8 - Common soldiers, city guards, predator animals</li>
						<li>Lv9 to Lv10 - Mercenaries, experienced soldiers, stronger predators</li>
						<li>Lv11 to Lv13 - Professional soldiers, military captains, some weak monsters</li>
						<li>Lv14 to Lv17 - Generals, guild leaders, more monsters</li>
						<li>Lv17 to Lv20 - Heroes, famous warriors, stronger monsters</li>
						<li>Lv20 and up - Legendary figures, epic monsters, etc.</li>
					</ul>
					<p>Every character starts with 60 Attribute Points (AP) and 3 Background Points (BP). Additionally, the 
						character also gains 1 additional AP, as well as 3 Skill Points (SP) per Lv. Some GMs further allow their 
						players to earn additional BP at certain Lvs, such as 3 base, +1 at Lv 5, +2 at Lv 10, +1 at Lv 15, and 
						+3 at Lv20; however, this is optional at the GM's discretion, and will be discussed during the <a href=
						"javascript:void(0);" onclick="scrolltoSection('Session-Zero')">Session Zero</a> for your specific game. 
						The different types of points will be discussed in detail further below.</p>

				<h2 id="Level-Up">Levelling Up</h2>
					<p>One of the main motivations for many players is the opportunity to advance and develop their character. 
						Of course, there any many ways to show character growth through roleplay, but the primary way to represent 
						character growth is by increasing your PC's level, by collecting Experience Points (XP).</p>
					<p>In order to level up, a PC needs to gain the same number of XP as the Lv they are trying to reach. In
						other words, if a PC is Lv4, their next Lv would be Lv5. Therefore, the PC needs to collect 5 XP.</p>
					<p>For every significant encounter, all surviving PCs gain 1 XP. The  definitiion of 'significant' in this 
						context is deliberately left vague, as it can vary between groups, as well as based on the Lv of the PCs 
						involved. For instance, going to a shop to buy a new sword is probably not significant regardless of PC 
						Lv, but fighting off a group of three zombies is significant for a Lv 1 or 2 PC, while it is quite 
						insignificant for a Lv 15 PC, or even a group of three Lv 5 PCs. As such, it is usually up the GM to 
						determine if an encounter is significant enough to warrant XP.</p>
					<p>Typically, this method is used to collect separate XP per individual PC, but some groups prefer to pool 
						their XP (both needed and collected), so that they can advance and grow together. This is up to the group 
						to determine during their <a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="scrolltoSection('Session-Zero')">Session 
						Zero</a> before the actual game starts</p>

				<h1 id="Background-Points">Background Points</h1>
					<p>Background Points (BP) are what makes your character unique. These points can be spent to acquire powerful 
						abilities that will define your PC and their playstyle throughout the entire game.</p>
					<p>While not strictly required, HammRPG recommends writing a backstory for your PC first, and only then creating 
						abilities that make sense within that backstory. Characters whose abilities are strongly intertwined with their 
						backstories tend to be more interesting from a role-play perspective, which improves immersion for yourself as 
						well as everyone else at the table.</p>
					<p>Please refer to the <a href="./creation.html">Character Creation</a> guide as well as the <a 
						href="./skillcreation.html">Skill Creation Guide</a>, and talk to your GM to create your own custom abilities.</p>

				<h1 id="Skill-Points">Skill Points</h1>
					<p>Skill Points (SP) are very similar to BP, except that they are less powerful. For instance, a single BP could grant 
						your character a +5 bonus for a given ability, while a SP would only grant a +1.</p>
					<p>The biggest advantage of SP over BP is that you get a lot more of them, which allows you to diversify your PC much 
						more. Additionally, SP are designed to be a more fluid representation of your PC's current abilities, rather than a 
						fixed picture of their background. As a result, most GMs will make it much easier to change SP abilities than BP 
						abilities (see PP section below).</p>
					<p>The two most common types of abilities are proficiencies, which provide a bonus to ability or attack rolls (atk), 
						and active abilities, which use MP to achieve much stronger bonuses to certain individual Actions alone.</p>

						href="./skillcreation.html">Skill Creation Guide</a>, and talk to your GM to create your own custom abilities.</p>
