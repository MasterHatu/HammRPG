				<h1>Sep 21, 2023</h1>
				<p>Welcome to the new HammRPG website!</p>
				<p>As you can see, the website looks pretty basic for now, but we're working on it while we continue to use 
					the Discord server.	The main reason for the website is that it's much better for organizing information 
					such as gameplay rules, terminology, status effects, etc.	As such, these pages are the first ones that 
					will be made functional.</p>
				<p>Over time, we hope to use the website to do all sorts of things:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Dice rolling</li>
					<li>Asynchronous map implementation, so that players can move their own characters even when not online 
						at the same time</li>
					<li>We might be able to use an AI assistant to automatically summarize the campaigns for us, removing 
						technical details such as rolls and	rule discussions, so that reader can just focus on the story (for 
						example, if someone had to take a break for a while, they can just read the summary story and jump 
						right back into it, instead of having to read 200 pages).</li>
				</ul>
