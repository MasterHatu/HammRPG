				<h2 id="Abilities">Abilities</h2>
					<p>All characters have acccess to the same set of basic Abilities, which are influenced by the most appropriate 
						<a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="scrolltoSection('Attributes')">Attribute</a>:</p>

					<h3 id="Endurance">Endurance</h3>
						<p>Endurance is a character's cardio. In essence, how long can an effort be sustained before you run out of 
							steam. While there is no specific combat-Action based on Endurance, your GM can ask you for an Endurance roll 
							if you perform repeated <a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="scrolltoSection('Sprint-Action')">Sprinting</a> 
							attempts or other strenuous tasks.</p>
						<p>Endurance can also be used to help calculate travel times for long distance trips, etc.</p>

					<h3 id="Resistance">Resistance</h3>
						<p>Resistance is one of the less-used abilities. Generally, it applies as a save against hostile attempts to 
							affect your character, such as Grappling attempts or attacks that attempt to stun your character.</p>
						<p>Some GMs also like to use the Resistance ability to reduce the potency of certain effects, such as poisons, 
							but this is up to the GM and should be discussed during your group's <a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick=
							"scrolltoSection('Session-Zero')">Session Zero</a>.</p>

					<h3 id="Athletics">Athletics</h3>
						<p>Athletics is a measure of the direct physical force a character's body can muster on short notice. Trying to 
							push a heavy object, lift a rock, or compete in an arm-wrestling match are all typical examples that would 
							warrant an Athletics roll.</p>
						<p id="Sprint-Action">In combat, the most common Athletics check you will see is the Sprint Action:</p>
						<p>A Sprint Action is an attempt to gain additional Movement so that you can move across the battlefield more 
							quickly, or run away from an overpowering enemy. If you spend a combat-Action to try to sprint:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>less than 0 => no bonus Movement (the Action is still spent, though!)</li>
							<li>0 to 9 => +1 m of Movement</li>
							<li>10 to 19 => +2 m of Movement</li>
							<li>20 to 29 => +3 m of Movement</li>
							<li>etc.</li>
						</ul>
				
					<h3 id="Grappling">Grappling</h3>
						<p>Grappling is an attempt to hold an enemy down, preventing them from moving and using Actions freely. This 
							can be done to protect your allies, prevent an enemy from running away, or simply to stop a spellcaster from 
							casting. Grappling is almost exclusively a combat action, which means if you attempt it in a non-combat 
							encounter, it will usually turn into a combat encounter.</p>
						<p>First, the initiating grappler rolls their atk roll, which is a Grappling ability roll with Unarmed Proficiency. 
							The resulting number is then compared to the target's DV to see if the target simply dodges the attack 
							altogether. Finally, if the target does not dodge, the defender also rolls a Grappling roll to determine 
							who gains control in the struggle. The initial Grappling attempt does not deal any damage.</p>
						<p>If the attacker gains control, the Grapple is maintained, and the attacker continues their turn. 
							If the defender gains control, they may choose to immediately let go of the Grapple, or maintain 
							it as is. Regardless of who gains control, <i>both</i> contestants gain the <b>Grappled</b> 
							effect as long as the Grapple is maintained.</p>
						<p>While grappled, the contestants can only perform the following Actions (rolling with disadvantage unless 
							they are in control of the contest):</p>
						<ul>
							<li><u>Gain Control</u>: The character performing this Action simply re-rolls their Grappling attempt. The 
								DC for this is calculated according to the normal DC formula, based on the opponent's most recent Grappling 
								roll. This Action can also be used to improve already existing control of a Grappling contest; however, it 
								does not deal any damage.</li>
							<li><u>Shove Action</u>: The initiator rolls Athletics, while the defender rolls Resistance. The winner may 
								then dictate up to 1 m of movement for each 5 points of lead in the contest. For example, if the 
								contest results are 5 vs 18, the character that rolled the 18 can move both characters by up to 2 
								m each ((18 - 5) / 5 = 2). Such Movment is only possible if the winner actually has the necessary 
								Movement available, but the looser's Movement is ignored within this context.</li>
							<li>Unarmed Attack</li>
							<li>Intimidation Action</li>
							<li>Pickpocket Action</li>
							<li>Knowledge Check</li>
							<li>Intuition Check</li>
							<li>Perception Check</li>
							<li>Inspiration Action</li>
							<li>Distraction Action</li>
						</ul>
				
					<h3 id="Intimidation">Intimidation</h3>
						<p>An Intimidation Action is an attempt to frighten the enemy, which is represented by the <b>Feared</b> 
							effect when in combat. It functions similar to the Grappling contest, except that the initiator rolls Intimidation, 
							while the target rolls Leadership as a measure of their level of discipline.</p>
						<p>Intimidation is usually specific to the one target, but can in some cases also apply to a group of targets. 
							In such situations, the GM will ususally increase the DC based on how many targets are around. In other words, 
							the more allies a target has around them, the higher their chance of resisting an Intimidation attempt.</p>

					<h3 id="Acrobatics">Acrobatics</h3>
						<p>Acrobatics represents a character's general agility.</p>
						<p id="Jump-Action">In many instances, a character may need to perform a Jump Action, for example to cross a 
							chasm, to avoid triggering a pressure plate trap, etc.:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>less than 0 => the jump critically fails, which may mean the PC falls into the chasm, triggers the trap, 
								etc. without the opportunity to try to save the situation</li>
							<li>0 to 4 => the jump fails, but the PC may roll a Reflex save to stop themselves. The DC for the save is 
								20 - the existing Acrobatics roll</li>
							<li>5 to 9 => the jump clears up to 1 m</li>
							<li>10 to 14 => the jump clears up to 2 m</li>
							<li>15 to 19 => the jump clears up to 3 m</li>
							<li>20 to 24 => the jump clears up to 4 m</li>
							<li>25 to 29 => the jump clears up to 5 m</li>
							<li>etc.</li>
						</ul>
						<p>Note that the Jump distance <b>does</b> count towards your Movement when you are in combat. In other words, 
							if your PC has only 3 tiles of Movement left, they can only jump up to 3 tiles, even if they roll a wicked 
							Acrobatics check (let's say a 42 or something like that).</p>

					<h3 id="Reflex">Reflex</h3>
						<p>Reflex is primarily a save against enemy attempts to place a character under an effect. It can also be used 
							as a save when the character experiences sudden unexpected (and usually very negative) situations.</p>
						<p>For example, if your character has to climb a rope to cross a deep chasm, rolling very low on an <a href=
							"javascript:void(0);" onclick="scrolltoSection('Acrobatics')">Acrobatics</a> check could result in your 
							character falling to their death. Rather than having such high stakes rely upon a single roll, the GM may 
							allow the falling character a Reflex save to try to catch the rope again.</p>
						<p id="Disengage">In combat, retreat may sometimes be the most viable strategy. A Disengage Action therefore 
							represents an attempt to leave an enemy's melee range, but as you will see in the <a href="javascript:void(0);" 
							onclick="scrolltoSection('AOO')">Attack of Opportunity</a> section, this may give the enemy a potential 
							opportunity to attack even though it is not their turn. The disengage is the fleeing character's attempt to 
							avoid this attack, by spending an Action of their own to contest the enemy's atk with a Reflex ability 
							roll.</p>
				
					<h3 id="Stealth">Stealth</h3>
						<p>Sneaking represents an attempt to prevent an enemy from knowing where you are or what you are doing. While, 
							mathematically, this is represented by a simple ability check, the actual chance of success is much more 
							complicated:</p>
						<p>At minimum, you will likely have to break line-of-sight, and reduce the noises you make. You'll have to 
							carefully examine the battlemap and decide where you want to position yourself, and then move as little as 
							possible.</p>
						<p>Unfortunately, your GM will most likely not tell you if your attempt at stealth is successful or not until 
							the consequences are already self-evident...</p>
						<p id="Sneak-Attack">In combat, if you manage to stay hidden, the first attack you make from a successful 
							stealth attempt counts as a Sneak Attack, which means the dmg roll for the atk will be multiplied by 2.</p>
						<div class="Highlight">
							<h2>Successful Sneak Attack = dmg *2</h2>
						</div>

					<h3 id="Pickpocket-Action">Pickpocket Action (Thievery)</h3>
						<p>As a combat action, pickpocketing represents an attempt to manipulate your enemy's inventory. This can be 
							straightforward as grabbing a key from their belt, or as subtle as switching one of their healing potions 
							for a poison flask from your own inventory. Obviously, if the enemy has already spotted you, the DC for the 
							attempt will be higher, but distractions in the form of Grappling or Performance rolls can sometimes help 
							you achieve success.</p>
						<p>For obvious reasons, this action can only be performed if you are in melee range of your target.</p>

					<h3 id="Knowledge-Check">Knowledge Check (History)</h3>
						<p>A History check is essential when special enemy types appear on the battlefield. Certain enemies will either 
							be immune to certain damage types, or may even be healed or strengthened by them instead. Think of a fire 
							elemental, for example. Not only does it not care about you waving a torch in its face, but stoking its flames 
							would actually make it stronger.</p>
						<p>The History check is therefore there to try to find out what the enemy may be vulnerable to, or resistant 
							against.</p>

					<h3 id="Targeting-Action">Targeting Action (Investigation)</h3>
						<p>Taking a second to pick your target's weak spot is useful, especially if your enemy has not seen you yet. 
							It essentially sacrifices one action in order to make the next attack stronger:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>less than 0 => no bonus</li>
							<li>0 to 4 => +1 atk and +2 dmg</li>
							<li>5 to 9 => +2 atk and +4 dmg</li>
							<li>10 to 14 => +3 atk and +6 dmg</li>
							<li>15 to 19 => +4 atk and +8 dmg</li>
							<li>20 to 24 => +5 atk and +10 dmg</li>
							<li>25 to 29 => +6 atk and +12 dmg</li>
						</ul>

					<h3 id="Intuition-Check">Intuition Check</h3>
						<p>If you're stuck and not really sure what to do, you can also use an Intuition check to essentaily ask your 
							GM for some hints. A Knowledge check can only give you information that your PC would reasonably know based 
							on their backstory and previous encounters, but a good Intuition check might allow you to infer brand new 
							conclusions.</p>

					<h3 id="Perception-Check">Perception Check</h3>
						<p>This is a quick physical check of your surroundings. If you suspect that there might be enemies in hiding, 
							waiting to ambush you, or if you think an area might be trapped, it may be a good idea to spend an Action 
							just making sure you have a good lay of the land before charging in.</p>
						<p>As for all abilities, if you do not make a specific roll, your Passive Perception is 0 + your modifiers. In 
							other words, even if you get the lowest possible roll on your ability check, you will get more information 
							than simply waiting for the GM to tell you what's happening. Some GMs will wait for you to ask them for a 
							Perception check, rather than potentially giving you a hint that there might be something hidden by asking 
							you for it.</p>

					<h3 id="Inspiration-Action">Inspiration Action</h3>
						<p>If you have a very critical roll coming up, you can spnd an Action to psych yourself up for it. This is 
							very similar to the <a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="scrolltoSection('Targeting-Action')">
							Targeting Action</a> for atk rolls, but for ability checks. Note that the bonuses are reduced:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>less than 0 => no bonus</li>
							<li>0 to 9 => +1 next ability roll</li>
							<li>10 to 19 => +2 next ability roll</li>
							<li>20 to 29 => +3 next ability roll</li>
						</ul>
						<p>You will also roll Inspiration every time you spend a <a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="scrolltoSection(
							'Party-Point')">Party Point</a> on yourself, although in that case it does not cost you an Action.</p>

					<h3 id="Help-Others-Action">Help Others Action (Leadership)</h3>
						<p>In the same spirit as the <a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="scrolltoSection('Inspiration-Action')">
							Inspiration Action</a>, you can also spend an Action to help one of your allies. These bonuses are higher, 
							though, especially if you roll well:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>less than 0 => no bonus</li>
							<li>0 to 4 => +1</li>
							<li>5 to 9 => +2</li>
							<li>10 to 14 => +3</li>
							<li>15 to 19 => +4</li>
							<li>20 to 24 => +5</li>
							<li>25 to 29 => +6</li>
						</ul>
						<p>When you spend <a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="scrolltoSection('Party-Point')">Party Points</a> on 
							your allies instead of yourself, you will also be able to use the Leadership roll instead of the Inspiration 
							roll.</p>

					<h3 id="Distraction-Action">Distraction Action (Performance)</h3>
						<p>This is essentially the opposite of a <a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="scrolltoSection('Sneak-Action')">
						Sneak Action</a>, and can be used to help take the attention away from your allies so that they can perform a 
						critical task more safely, or to lure enemies into a trap. The GM will determine the DC of the roll based on the 
						specific context, including your role-play for the distraction.</p>
