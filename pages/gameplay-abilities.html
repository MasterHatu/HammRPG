			<article>
				<h2 id="Abilities">Abilities</h2>
					<p>All characters have acccess to the same set of basic Abilities, which are influenced by the most appropriate 
						<a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="scrolltoSection('Attributes')">Attribute</a>:</p>

					<h3 id="Endurance">Endurance</h3>
						<p>Endurance is a character's cardio. In essence, how long can an effort be sustained before you run out of 
							steam. While there is no specific combat-Action based on Endurance, your GM can ask you for an Endurance roll 
							if you perform repeated <a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="scrolltoSection('Sprint-Action')">Sprinting</a> 
							attempts or other strenuous tasks.</p>
						<p>Endurance can also be used to help calculate travel times for long distance trips, etc.</p>

					<h3 id="Resistance">Resistance</h3>
						<p>Resistance is one of the less-used abilities. Generally, it applies as a save against hostile attempts to 
							affect your character, such as Grappling attempts or attacks that attempt to stun your character.</p>
						<p>Some GMs also like to use the Resistance ability to reduce the potency of certain effects, such as poisons, 
							but this is up to the GM and should be discussed during your group's <a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick=
							"scrolltoSection('Session-Zero')">Session Zero</a>.</p>

					<h3 id="Athletics">Athletics</h3>
						<p>Athletics is a measure of the direct physical force a character's body can muster on short notice. Trying to 
							push a heavy object, lift a rock, or compete in an arm-wrestling match are all typical examples that would 
							warrant an Athletics roll.</p>
						<p id="Sprint-Action">In combat, the most common Athletics check you will see is the Sprint Action:</p>
						<p>A Sprint Action is an attempt to gain additional Movement so that you can move across the battlefield more 
							quickly, or run away from an overpowering enemy. If you spend a combat-Action to try to sprint:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>less than 0 => no bonus Movement (the Action is still spent, though!)</li>
							<li>0 to 9 => +1 m of Movement</li>
							<li>10 to 19 => +2 m of Movement</li>
							<li>20 to 29 => +3 m of Movement</li>
							<li>etc.</li>
						</ul>
				
					<h3 id="Grappling">Grappling</h3>
						<p>Grappling is an attempt to hold an enemy down, preventing them from moving and using Actions freely. This 
							can be done to protect your allies, prevent an enemy from running away, or simply to stop a spellcaster from 
							casting. Grappling is almost exclusively a combat action, which means if you attempt it in a non-combat 
							encounter, it will usually turn into a combat encounter.</p>
						<p>First, the initiating grappler rolls their atk roll, which is a Grappling ability roll with Unarmed 
							Proficiency. The resulting number is then compared to the target's DV to see if the target simply dodges 
							the attack altogether. Finally, if the target does not dodge, the defender also rolls a Grappling roll to 
							determine who gains control in the struggle. The initial Grappling attempt does not deal any damage.</p>
						<p>If the attacker gains control, the Grapple is maintained, and the attacker continues their turn. 
							If the defender gains control, they may choose to immediately let go of the Grapple, or maintain 
							it as is. Regardless of who gains control, <i>both</i> contestants gain the <b>Grappled</b> 
							effect as long as the Grapple is maintained.</p>
						<p>While grappled, the contestants can only perform the following Actions (rolling with disadvantage unless 
							they are in control of the contest):</p>
						<ul>
							<li><u>Gain Control</u>: The character performing this Action simply re-rolls their Grappling attempt. The 
								DC for this is calculated according to the normal DC formula, based on the opponent's most recent Grappling 
								roll. This Action can also be used to improve already existing control of a Grappling contest; however, it 
								does not deal any damage.</li>
							<li><u>Shove Action</u>: The initiator rolls Athletics, while the defender rolls Resistance. The winner may 
								then dictate up to 1 m of movement for each 5 points of lead in the contest. For example, if the 
								contest results are 5 vs 18, the character that rolled the 18 can move both characters by up to 2 
								m each ((18 - 5) / 5 = 2). Such Movment is only possible if the winner actually has the necessary 
								Movement available, but the looser's Movement is ignored within this context.</li>
							<li>Unarmed Attack</li>
							<li>Intimidation Action</li>
							<li>Pickpocket Action</li>
							<li>Knowledge Check</li>
							<li>Intuition Check</li>
							<li>Perception Check</li>
							<li>Inspiration Action</li>
							<li>Distraction Action</li>
						</ul>
				
					<h3 id="Intimidation">Intimidation</h3>
						<p>An Intimidation Action is an attempt to frighten the enemy, which is represented by the <b>Feared</b> 
							effect when in combat. It functions similar to the Grappling contest, except that the initiator rolls 
							Intimidation, while the target rolls Leadership as a measure of their level of discipline.</p>
						<p>Intimidation is usually specific to the one target, but can in some cases also apply to a group of targets. 
							In such situations, the GM will ususally increase the DC based on how many targets are around. In other words, 
							the more allies a target has around them, the higher their chance of resisting an Intimidation attempt.</p>

					<h3 id="Acrobatics">Acrobatics</h3>
						<p>Acrobatics represents a character's general agility.</p>
						<p id="Jump-Action">In many instances, a character may need to perform a Jump Action, for example to cross a 
							chasm, to avoid triggering a pressure plate trap, etc.:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>less than 0 => the jump critically fails, which may mean the PC falls into the chasm, triggers the trap, 
								etc. without the opportunity to try to save the situation</li>
							<li>0 to 4 => the jump fails, but the PC may roll a Reflex save to stop themselves. The DC for the save is 
								20 - the existing Acrobatics roll</li>
							<li>5 to 9 => the jump clears up to 1 m</li>
							<li>10 to 14 => the jump clears up to 2 m</li>
							<li>15 to 19 => the jump clears up to 3 m</li>
							<li>20 to 24 => the jump clears up to 4 m</li>
							<li>25 to 29 => the jump clears up to 5 m</li>
							<li>etc.</li>
						</ul>
						<p>Note that the Jump distance <b>does</b> count towards your Movement when you are in combat. In other words, 
							if your PC has only 3 tiles of Movement left, they can only jump up to 3 tiles, even if they roll a wicked 
							Acrobatics check (let's say a 42 or something like that).</p>

					<h3 id="Reflex">Reflex</h3>
						<p>Reflex is primarily a save against enemy attempts to place a character under an effect. It can also be used 
							as a save when the character experiences sudden unexpected (and usually very negative) situations.</p>
						<p>For example, if your character has to climb a rope to cross a deep chasm, rolling very low on an <a href=
							"javascript:void(0);" onclick="scrolltoSection('Acrobatics')">Acrobatics</a> check could result in your 
							character falling to their death. Rather than having such high stakes rely upon a single roll, the GM may 
							allow the falling character a Reflex save to try to catch the rope again.</p>
						<p id="Disengage">In combat, retreat may sometimes be the most viable strategy. A Disengage Action therefore 
							represents an attempt to leave an enemy's melee range, but as you will see in the <a href="javascript:void(0);" 
							onclick="scrolltoSection('AOO')">Attack of Opportunity</a> section, this may give the enemy a potential 
							opportunity to attack even though it is not their turn. The disengage is the fleeing character's attempt to 
							avoid this attack, by spending an Action of their own to contest the enemy's atk with a Reflex ability 
							roll.</p>
				
					<h3 id="Stealth">Stealth</h3>
						<p>Sneaking represents an attempt to prevent an enemy from knowing where you are or what you are doing. While, 
							mathematically, this is represented by a simple ability check, the actual chance of success is much more 
							complicated:</p>
						<p>At minimum, you will likely have to break line-of-sight, and reduce the noises you make. You'll have to 
							carefully examine the battlemap and decide where you want to position yourself, and then move as little as 
							possible.</p>
						<p>Unfortunately, your GM will most likely not tell you if your attempt at stealth is successful or not until 
							the consequences are already self-evident...</p>
						<p id="Sneak-Attack">In combat, if you manage to stay hidden, the first attack you make from a successful 
							stealth attempt counts as a Sneak Attack, which means the dmg roll for the atk will be multiplied by 2.</p>
						<div class="Highlight">
							<h2>Successful Sneak Attack = dmg *2</h2>
						</div>

					<h3 id="Thievery">Thievery</h3>
						<p>Thievery is the ability that represents the subtler, and often not entirely legal, arts requiring delicate 
							manual dexterity. Lockpicking, trap-disarming, pickpocketing, etc, all fall into this category.</p>
						<p>As a combat action, pickpocketing represents an attempt to manipulate your enemy's inventory, for example, 
							grabbing a key from their belt, or switching one of their healing potions for a poison flask from your own 
							inventory. Obviously, if the enemy has already spotted you, the DC for the attempt will be higher, but 
							distractions in the form of Grappling or Performance rolls can sometimes help you achieve success.</p>
						<p>For obvious reasons, pickpocketing can only be performed if you are in melee range of your target.</p>

					<h3 id="Crafting">Crafting</h3>
						<p>Crafting is one of those abilities that are often overlooked, as you will rarely be asked to make a Crafting 
							roll. Nevertheless, characters trained in a craft can perform remarkable feats with it, and usually have a 
							much easier time acquiring gold than those who are not.</p>
						<p>The Crafting modifier becomes important when you are spending some down-time to collect ingredients:</p>
						<div class="Highlight">
							<h2># of ingredients collected per hour = 1d4 + Crafting Proficiency</h2>
						</div>
						<p>For every point of Proficiency bonus your character has, they can memorize a recipe to craft an item 
							corresponding to that profession. The <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1QkFdJyOYmSCuLDvVvT-
							ryOK-unPjXyxaJk77vcSobVA/edit?usp=sharing">Armory</a> contains some ideas for items, but you can also 
							create custom items for yourself. You and your GM will then have to figure out the ingredient cost for 
							your custom recipes before you can actually create them in the game.</p>
						<p>For instance, if your chosen craft is Alchemy, you could use one of your recipe memory slots to memorize 
							how to make a healing potion. While it is entirely possible to purchase a recipe from a merchant, or even 
							find it while you are out adventuring, those recipes that are not memorized can only be created as long as 
							you have the recipe in your inventory, meaning it can be stolen from you, or the page might get destroyed 
							while you cross a river... Memorized recipes cannot be lost.</p>
						<p>Note that the INT modifier that usually applies to an ability <i>does not</i> count towards your recipe 
							limit, but it <i>does</i> get factored in when you are collecting ingredients or calculating hourly wage, 
							as described below.</p>
						<div class="Highlight">
							<h2>Recipe Limit = Crafting Proficiency (without INT modifier)</h2>
						</div>
						<p>Another way to use the Crafting ability is to calculate a better wage for skilled workers compared to 
							those without a learned craft (keep in mind that you can only earn this better wage if there is demand 
							for it - for example, you can only get a blacksmith's pay if you are actually working as a blacksmith):</p>
						<div class="Highlight">
							<h2>In-game Hourly wage = Crafting Proficiency (minimum 2 gold per hour)</h2>
						</div>

					<h3 id="History">History</h3>
						<p>History checks can be rolled when you are trying to remember something specific to your past. This can 
							include knowledge that your character would have based on their backstory - even if the player that 
							controls the character doesn't have that knowledge, or it can mean small bits of information that your 
							GM may have given you before, but you just need a little reminder.</p>
						<p>In combat, a History check is essential when special enemy types appear on the battlefield. Certain 
							enemies will either be immune to certain damage types, or may even be healed or strengthened by them 
							instead. Think of a fire elemental, for example. Not only does it not care about you waving a torch in 
							its face, but stoking its flames would actually make it stronger. The History check is therefore there 
							to try to remember any special information about what  the enemy may be vulnerable to, or resistant 
							against.</p>
						<p></p>

					<h3 id="Investigation">Investigation</h3>
						<p>Investigation comes into play when you are trying to figure out brand new information. Where a History 
							check refers to specific information you have learned before, Investigation can help you figure out 
							something you never knew before.</p>
						<p>Investigation is also useful when you are searching for something, such as a trap, or a clue about 
							something. In this context, it overlaps slightly with Perception, but Investigation is more of a hands-
							on search, looking under that pile of leaves or questioning suspects, while Perception is simply 
							observation without interference.</p>
						<p>In combat, it can also be useful to take a second to pick your target's weak spot, especially if your
							enemy has not seen you yet. It essentially sacrifices one action in order to make the next attack 
							stronger:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>less than 0 => no bonus</li>
							<li>0 to 4 => +1 atk and +2 dmg</li>
							<li>5 to 9 => +2 atk and +4 dmg</li>
							<li>10 to 14 => +3 atk and +6 dmg</li>
							<li>15 to 19 => +4 atk and +8 dmg</li>
							<li>20 to 24 => +5 atk and +10 dmg</li>
							<li>25 to 29 => +6 atk and +12 dmg</li>
						</ul>

					<h3 id="Intuition">Intuition</h3>
						<p>If you're stuck and not really sure what to do, you can also use an Intuition check to essentaily ask your 
							GM for some hints. Think of it as a form of 'sixth sense'. A History check can only give you information 
							that your PC would reasonably know based on their backstory and previous encounters, and an Investigation 
							can lead to logically formed conclusion, but a good Intuition check might allow you to infer brand new 
							information right in the heat of the moment.</p>
						<p>Despite this vague description, Intuition comes up rather often, as it bridges the gap that may occur 
							between GM and players based on their own thinking styles. If your GM is giving you information and you 
							just can't seem to put the pieces of the puzzle together, it might be worth asking for an Intuition check 
							as well.</p>

					<h3 id="Perception">Perception</h3>
						<p>This is a quick physical check of your surroundings. If you suspect that there might be enemies in hiding, 
							waiting to ambush you, or if you think an area might be trapped, or even just if you really enjoy a 
							scene your GM is describing, it may be a good idea to spend an Action just making sure you have a good lay 
							of the land before interacting.</p>
						<p>As for all abilities in HammRPG, <u>if you do not make a specific roll, your Passive ability is 0 + your 
							modifiers</u>. In other words, even if you get the lowest possible roll on your ability check, you will 
							get more information than simply waiting for the GM to tell you what's happening. Some GMs will wait for 
							you to ask them for a Perception check, rather than potentially giving you a hint that there might be 
							something hidden by asking you for it.</p>

					<h3 id="Survival">Survival</h3>
						<p>Survival represents your character's navigational abilities, especially in nature, as well as their 
							ability to communicate when they do not speak the same language as their counterpart, which often comes 
							into play when trying to communicate with animals. Survival is also a common check when you are affected 
							by effects such as Blinded or Deafened, or when you are in the middle of a dust-cloud or smoke-screen.</p>

					<h3 id="Willpower">Willpower</h3>
						<p>Willpower is a common save against enemy attempts to use magic against a character. If your character 
							is ever captured, you can also use a Willpower roll to see how well they are resisting hostile attempts to 
							interrogate your PC, etc.</p>

					<h3 id="Inspiration">Inspiration</h3>
						<p>If you have a very critical roll coming up, you can psych yourself up for it using your own internal 
							monologue as Inspiration (Note that this costs an Action in combat, unless you are spending PP):</p>
						<ul>
							<li>less than 0 => no bonus</li>
							<li>0 to 9 => +1 next ability roll</li>
							<li>10 to 19 => +2 next ability roll</li>
							<li>20 to 29 => +3 next ability roll</li>
						</ul>

					<h3 id="Leadership">Leadership</h3>
						<p>Leadership functions as a measure of your disciplice and your ability to inspire others. As such, it 
							is the default save against enemy attempts to <a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="scrolltoSection(
							'Intimidation')">Intimidate</a> you.</p>
						<p>In the same spirit as the <a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="scrolltoSection('Inspiration')">
							Inspiration Action</a> above, you can also spend an Action to help one of your allies. The bonuses for 
							helping your friends are higher, though, especially if you roll well:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>less than 0 => no bonus</li>
							<li>0 to 4 => +1</li>
							<li>5 to 9 => +2</li>
							<li>10 to 14 => +3</li>
							<li>15 to 19 => +4</li>
							<li>20 to 24 => +5</li>
							<li>25 to 29 => +6</li>
						</ul>
						<p>When you spend PP to help your allies instead of yourself, you will also be able to use the Leadership 
							roll instead of the Inspiration roll, which makes helping others more effective than helping yourself, 
							specifically in order to encourage teamwork.</p>

					<h3 id="Performance">Performance</h3>
						<p>Performance refers to your ability to handle the spotlight. Whether performing in a tavern or running a 
							distraction while your allies steal something or sneak up on a critical enemy, Performance has a huge 
							variety of applications. The GM will determine the DC of the roll based on the specific context, including 
							your role-play for the distraction and/or any details you describe.</p>

					<h3 id="Persuasion">Persuasion</h3>
						<p>Persuasion is the art of word-craft, which means it will most commonly come into play when you role-play 
							conversations and similar situations. Some spells, particularly charms and such, can also utilize the 
							Persuasion ability for their applicable contests.</p>
						<p>If you or your GM do not enjoy the haggling experience, you can also use Persuasion as an easy way to 
							calculate discounts when buying or selling items. The formula for this is given in the Charisma section 
							of the <a href="./gameplay-attributes.html">Attributes</a> page; however, using Persuasion rather than 
							the base CHA modifier allows you to take advantage of Persuasion proficiency. Which of these two methods 
							you end up using should be discussed during the <a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="scrolltoSection(
							'Session-Zero')">Session Zero</a> for your game.</p>
