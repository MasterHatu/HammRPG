				<h1>The HammRPG Concept</h1>
				<p>HammRPG is a tabletop roleplaying game (TTRPG) that allows players to collectively create and narrate a story 
					together. One player takes on the role of the Game Master (GM), who drives the story forward and plays all the 
					non-player characters (NPCs), while the other players create their own player characters (PCs) and work together with 
					the GM to tell a unique and exciting story.</p>
				<p>HammRPG is a collaborative storytelling game. This means that the GM and players all work together to create 
					a story through cooperation and teamwork. No one player is more important than the others and everyone has a 
					say in how the story unfolds by roleplaying their PC's choices, actions, and conversations. The more you immerse 
					yourself into your character and try to think and act from their perspective, the more fun everyone will have. 
					That being said, keep in mind that the player behind the character is always more important than the character or 
					the even the story itself!</p>
				<p>The main concept that sets HammRPG apart from other TTRPGs is its focus on customizability. Where some games may 
					have you choose certain abilities from a pre-made list of possible features, HammRPG allows each player to create 
					their own entirely customized abilities from scratch. Your character can be as synergized or ramshackled as you 
					like, providing for a virtually infinitely complex combination of character features and roleplay opportunities. 
					In order ensure all players have the same opportunity to shine, we recommend using the <a href="./abilities.html">
					Ability</a> guide to create your custom abilities. This will enable you to plan how your PC will develop over time, 
					helps with balancing, and might also provide some ideas for abilities you may not have thought of.</p>
				<p>The below rules section is designed to help players create a fun and engaging storytelling experience. It provides 
					a framework for resolving conflicts, handling challenges, and advancing the story in a way that is hopefully fair 
					to everyone at the table. However, it's important to remember that the rules are not meant to be restrictive - 
					the group should always feel free to adapt the rules as needed to best serve their specific story.</p>

				<h1>Character Level</h1>
				<p>Mathematically, the main measurement of advancement and power of a character is the character level (Lv).</p>
				<p>The lowest possible Lv is Lv1, and while theoretically there is no upper limit to Lv, the higher you go the 
					more complicated the game becomes. As the number of abilities continues to increase for both PCs and NPCs, it 
					becomes increasingly difficult to keep track of everything, and so, for practicality, we typically scale NPCs up to 
					approximately Lv20, as shown below (Note that this is only a rough guide, and many exceptions may exist at the 
					discretion of the GM.):</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Lv1 to Lv3 - Slaves, prisoners, and other characters that have been deliberately weakened</li>
					<li>Lv4 to Lv6 - Average citizens, grunt soldiers, or common animals</li>
					<li>Lv7 to Lv8 - Common soldiers, city guards, predator animals</li>
					<li>Lv9 to Lv10 - Mercenaries, experienced soldiers, stronger predators</li>
					<li>Lv11 to Lv13 - Professional soldiers, military captains, some weak monsters</li>
					<li>Lv14 to Lv17 - Generals, guild leaders, more monsters</li>
					<li>Lv17 to Lv20 - Heroes, famous warriors, stronger monsters</li>
					<li>Lv20 and up - Legendary figures, epic monsters, etc.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Every character starts with 60 Attribute Points (AP) and 3 Background Points (BP). Additionally, the 
					character also gains 1 additional AP, as well as 3 Skill Points (SP) per Lv. Some GMs further allow their 
					players to earn additional BP at certain Lvs, such as 3 base, +1 at Lv 5, +2 at Lv 10, +1 at Lv 15, and 
					+3 at Lv20; however, this is optional at the GM's discretion, and will be discussed during the Session Zero 
					for your specific game. The different types of points will be discussed in detail further below.</p>

				<h1>Attributes</h1>
				<p>HammRPG uses six common attributes to define a character's general affinity with certain abilities: 
					Constitution (CON), Strength (STR), Dexterity (DEX), Intelligence (INT), Wisdom (WIS) and Charisma (CHA).</p>
				<p>Attributes are used in two different ways:</p>
				<ol>
					<li>The attribute value itself.</li>
					<li>An ability modifier based on that attribute.</li>
				</ol>
				<p>For all attributes, HammRPG uses the full name (e.g.: Constitution) when referring to the attribute 
					itself, while we use use the abbreviation (e.g.: CON) when referring to the modifier.</p>

				<h1>Modifiers</h1>
				<p>Most modifiers are calculated based on the most relevant attributs. An attribute score of 10 is considered 
					average, resulting in no modifiers to rolls based on that attribute. If a character has an attribute score 
					lower than 10, they will have a negative modifier to those rolls, while an attribute higher than 10 will 
					grant a bonus to those rolls.</p>
				<p>The formula for calculating your modifier is:</p>
				<div class="Highlight">
					<h2>modifier = ( attribute - 10 ) / 2</h2>
				</div>
				<p><b>Note:</b> Only integer values are valid for modifier calculations. A result of less than 1 is always <i>
						rounded down</i> to the nearest full number.</p>
				<p>E.g. if a character has an attribute value of 11, their modifier is (11-10)/2=0.5 => 0.</p>
			</article>
			<article>
				<h2>Constitution</h2>
				<p>Constitution is a measure of a character's toughness, and their ability to withstand damage. The most 
					direct way to represent this is with the number of Health Points (HP) the character has:</p>
				<div class="Highlight">
					<h2>maxHP = Constitution * Lv</h2>
				</div>
				<p>Based on this formula, you can see that maxHP increases with higher values of Constitution, as well as 
					the character level itself. As such, a character with high Constitution will continue to gain larger amounts of 
					maxHP per level-up than one with low Constitution.</p>
				<p>Constitution also affects Physical Resistance (PR), which further helps your character withstand damage. The 
					PR modifier works the same as the regular CON modifier, except that it does not have negative values, even if 
					your Constitutionis less than 10.</p>
				<div class="Highlight">
					<article>
						<h5>If CON < 0:</h5>
						<h2>PR = 0</h2>
					</article>
					<article>
						<h5>If CON >= 0:</h5>
						<h2>PR = CON</h2>
					</article>
				</div>
				<p>Please refer to the damage calculation guide below for further details on PR.</p>
				<p>The Endurance and Resistance abilities are also based on Constitution.</p>
			</article>
			<article>
				<h2>Strength</h2>
				<p>Strength is a measure of the physical force that a character can exert. One of its largest benefits is 
					its effect on Melee Damage (MD), which will cause your melee attacks to hit harder. Just as PR does not 
					have negative values, MD also does not decrease a damage roll's (dmg) result.</p>
				<div class="Highlight">
					<article>
						<h5>If STR < 0:</h5>
								<h2>MD = 0</h2>
					</article>
					<article>
						<h5>If STR >= 0:</h5>
						<h2>MD = STR</h2>
					</article>
				</div>
				<p>Please refer to the damage calculation guide below for further details on MD.</p>
				<p>Strength also affects the Athletics, Grappling and Intimidation abilities.</p>
