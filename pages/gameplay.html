				<h1 id="Concept">The HammRPG Concept</h1>
					<p>HammRPG is a tabletop roleplaying game (TTRPG) that allows players to collectively create and narrate a story 
						together. One player takes on the role of the Game Master (GM), who drives the story forward and plays all the 
						non-player characters (NPCs), while the other players create their own player characters (PCs) and work together 
						with the GM to tell a unique and exciting story.</p>
					<p>HammRPG is a collaborative storytelling game. This means that the GM and players all work together to create 
						a story through cooperation and teamwork. No one player is more important than the others and everyone has a 
						say in how the story unfolds by roleplaying their PC's choices, actions, and conversations. The more you immerse 
						yourself into your character and try to think and act from their perspective, the more fun everyone will have. 
						That being said, keep in mind that the player behind the character is always more important than the character or 
						the even the story itself!</p>
					<p>The main concept that sets HammRPG apart from other TTRPGs is its focus on customizability. Where some games may 
						have you choose certain abilities from a pre-made list of possible features, HammRPG allows each player to create 
						their own entirely customized abilities from scratch. Your character can be as synergized or ramshackled as you 
						like, providing for a virtually infinitely complex combination of character features and roleplay opportunities. 
						In order ensure all players have the same opportunity to shine, we recommend using the <a href="./abilities.html">
						Ability Guide</a> to create your custom abilities. This will enable you to plan how your PC will develop over time, 
						helps with balancing, and might also provide some ideas for abilities you may not have thought of.</p>
					<p>The below rules section is designed to help players create a fun and engaging storytelling experience. It provides 
						a framework for resolving conflicts, handling challenges, and advancing the story in a way that is hopefully fair 
						to everyone at the table. However, it's important to remember that the rules are not meant to be restrictive - 
						the group should always feel free to adapt the rules as needed to best serve their specific story.</p>

				<h1 id="Encounters">Encounters</h1>
					<p>While outside of combat situations, your character is able to do essentially anything you can think of. When 
						an encounter starts, the GM will typically describe the situation first, then the players have an opportunity 
						to interact with that situation. Depending on what the players choose to do, the GM will then ask for appropriate 
						ability rolls to determine how well your character actually performs what you described, or respond from the 
						perspective of the NPCs the players interacted with, etc. The result of the roll, or the result of the role-play 
						then leads to certain consequences as described by the GM. This back-and-forth between describing, rolling and 
						interacting is the essence of HammRPG.</p>
					<p>As such, while not in combat, actions and abilities are relatively fluid and intuitive, rather than closely 
						defined. Nevertheless, you can find a general description of each of the <a href="javascript:void(0);" 
						onclick="scrolltoSection('Abilities')">Abilities</a> below.</p>
					<p>However, if a situation escalates into combat, time becomes a much more significant factor. This is where 
						HammRPG uses a turn-based combat system to slow down time in order to allow players (and the GM) to think about 
						their next move, describe their attacks or other Actions in epic detail, and still banter between each other 
						without the stress of real-time combat.</p>
					
				<h2 id="Dice-Rolling">Dice Rolling</h2>
					<p>Many of the actions described below are resolved by rolling dice. In such cases, HammRPG uses the XdX notation 
						style:</p>
					<div class="Highlight">
						<h2># of Dice + "d" + Type of Dice</h2>
					</div>
					<p>For example, one twenty-sided die is written as 1d20, three twelve-sided dice would be 3d12, etc.</p>
					<p>Normally, a roll consists of a single instance of rolling the appropriate dice, and then adding the appropriate 
						modifiers to the roll. However, in some instances a roll may be rolled with Disadvantage, or Advantage, which 
						means that we:</p>
					<div class="Highlight">
						<article>
							<h5>If Disadvantage</h5>
									<h2>roll twice and take the lower number</h2>
						</article>
						<article>
							<h5>If Advantage</h5>
							<h2>roll twice and take the higher number</h2>
						</article>
					</div>
					<p>The instances of disadvantage or advantage stack, which means that if there are multiple sources of advantage 
						or disadvantage, the number of total dice rolled also increases. Likewise, advantage and disadvantage cancel 
						each other out.</p>
					<p>For example, let's say our PC has a situation where they need to make a roll with 4 sources of Advantage and 
						2 sources of Disadvantage: Two of the advantage-disadvantage pair cancel each other out, and we are left with 
						2 instances of Advantage. As a result, we roll 3 dice (1 base, plus 1 for each instance of advantage), and 
						then take the highest resulting number.</p>
					<p>Any applicable modifiers are only applied after the roll itself, including advantage-disadvantage 
						considerations, have been completed.</p>
