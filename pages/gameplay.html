				<h1 id="Concept">The HammRPG Concept</h1>
					<p>HammRPG is a tabletop roleplaying game (TTRPG) that allows players to collectively create and narrate a story 
						together. One player takes on the role of the Game Master (GM), who drives the story forward and plays all the 
						non-player characters (NPCs), while the other players create their own player characters (PCs) and work together 
						with the GM to tell a unique and exciting story.</p>
					<p>HammRPG is a collaborative storytelling game. This means that the GM and players all work together to create 
						a story through cooperation and teamwork. No one player is more important than the others and everyone has a 
						say in how the story unfolds by roleplaying their PC's choices, actions, and conversations. The more you immerse 
						yourself into your character and try to think and act from their perspective, the more fun everyone will have. 
						That being said, keep in mind that the player behind the character is always more important than the character or 
						the even the story itself!</p>
					<p>The main concept that sets HammRPG apart from other TTRPGs is its focus on customizability. Where some games may 
						have you choose certain abilities from a pre-made list of possible features, HammRPG allows each player to create 
						their own entirely customized abilities from scratch. Your character can be as synergized or ramshackled as you 
						like, providing for a virtually infinitely complex combination of character features and roleplay opportunities. 
						In order ensure all players have the same opportunity to shine, we recommend using the <a href="./abilities.html">
						Ability Guide</a> to create your custom abilities. This will enable you to plan how your PC will develop over time, 
						helps with balancing, and might also provide some ideas for abilities you may not have thought of.</p>
					<p>The below rules section is designed to help players create a fun and engaging storytelling experience. It provides 
						a framework for resolving conflicts, handling challenges, and advancing the story in a way that is hopefully fair 
						to everyone at the table. However, it's important to remember that the rules are not meant to be restrictive - 
						the group should always feel free to adapt the rules as needed to best serve their specific story.</p>
			</article>
			
			<article>
				<h1 id="Level">Character Level</h1>
					<p>Mathematically, the main measurement of advancement and power of a character is the character level (Lv).</p>
					<p>The lowest possible Lv is Lv1, and while theoretically there is no upper limit to Lv, the higher you go the 
						more complicated the game becomes. As the number of abilities continues to increase for both PCs and NPCs, it 
						becomes increasingly difficult to keep track of everything, and so, for practicality, we typically scale NPCs up to 
						approximately Lv20, as shown below (Note that this is only a rough guide, and many exceptions may exist at the 
						discretion of the GM.):</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Lv1 to Lv3 - Slaves, prisoners, and other characters that have been deliberately weakened</li>
						<li>Lv4 to Lv6 - Average citizens, grunt soldiers, or common animals</li>
						<li>Lv7 to Lv8 - Common soldiers, city guards, predator animals</li>
						<li>Lv9 to Lv10 - Mercenaries, experienced soldiers, stronger predators</li>
						<li>Lv11 to Lv13 - Professional soldiers, military captains, some weak monsters</li>
						<li>Lv14 to Lv17 - Generals, guild leaders, more monsters</li>
						<li>Lv17 to Lv20 - Heroes, famous warriors, stronger monsters</li>
						<li>Lv20 and up - Legendary figures, epic monsters, etc.</li>
					</ul>
					<p>Every character starts with 60 Attribute Points (AP) and 3 Background Points (BP). Additionally, the 
						character also gains 1 additional AP, as well as 3 Skill Points (SP) per Lv. Some GMs further allow their 
						players to earn additional BP at certain Lvs, such as 3 base, +1 at Lv 5, +2 at Lv 10, +1 at Lv 15, and 
						+3 at Lv20; however, this is optional at the GM's discretion, and will be discussed during the <a href=
						"javascript:void(0);" onclick="scrolltoSection('Session-Zero')">Session Zero</a> for your specific game. 
						The different types of points will be discussed in detail further below.</p>
			</article>
			
			<article>
				<h2 id="Level-Up">Levelling Up</h2>
					<p>One of the main motivations for many players is the opportunity to advance and develop their character. 
						Of course, there any many ways to show character growth through roleplay, but the primary way to represent 
						character growth is by increasing your PC's level, by collecting Experience Points (XP).</p>
					<p>In order to level up, a PC needs to gain the same number of XP as the Lv they are trying to reach. In
						other words, if a PC is Lv4, their next Lv would be Lv5. Therefore, the PC needs to collect 5 XP.</p>
					<p>For every significant encounter, all surviving PCs gain 1 XP. The  definitiion of 'significant' in this 
						context is deliberately left vague, as it can vary between groups, as well as based on the Lv of the PCs 
						involved. For instance, going to a shop to buy a new sword is probably not significant regardless of PC 
						Lv, but fighting off a group of three zombies is significant for a Lv 1 or 2 PC, while it is quite 
						insignificant for a Lv 15 PC, or even a group of three Lv 5 PCs. As such, it is usually up the GM to 
						determine if an encounter is significant enough to warrant XP.</p>
					<p>Typically, this method is used to collect separate XP per individual PC, but some groups prefer to pool 
						their XP (both needed and collected), so that they can advance and grow together. This is up to the group 
						to determine during their <a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="scrolltoSection('Session-Zero')">Session 
						Zero</a> before the actual game starts</p>
			</article>

			<article>
				<h1 id="Attributes">Attributes</h1>
					<p>HammRPG uses six common attributes to define a character's general affinity with certain abilities: 
						Constitution (CON), Strength (STR), Dexterity (DEX), Intelligence (INT), Wisdom (WIS) and Charisma (CHA).</p>
					<p>Attributes are used in two different ways:</p>
					<ol>
						<li>The attribute value itself.</li>
						<li>An ability modifier based on that attribute.</li>
					</ol>
					<p>For all attributes, HammRPG uses the full name (e.g.: Constitution) when referring to the attribute 
						itself, while we use use the abbreviation (e.g.: CON) when referring to the modifier.</p>

					<h2 id="AP-Distribution">Attribute Point Distribution</h2>
						<p>There are various ways to allocate Attribute Points (AP) in your specific game. Which system you use should 
							be discussed during the <a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="scrolltoSection('Session-Zero')">Session 
							Zero</a> before you actually start playing.</p>
						<p>The main method of attribute point distribution endorsed by HammRPG is sometimes called Point-Buy: All 
							characters start with 60 Attribute Points (AP), and gain 1 additional AP per Lv. These points can be 
							allocated to any of the attributes entirely at the player's preference. This is the default method, as it 
							allows complete player freedon in their character creation, and results in characters that should be at 
							least reasonably similar in power compared to each other. Of course, in a game as customizable as HammRPG, 
							complete balance is nearly impossible, as one set of abilities might synergize better than another.</p>
						<p>Another popular method is Stat-Rolling: Each player rolls three six-sided dice (3d6) six times. The results 
							of the rolls are either appended to the attributes in order, or at the player's preference, per group 
							discussion. This method introduces an element of randomness, which can result in wildly different characters 
							strength levels. While experienced players may relish the challenge of adjusting their play-style according 
							to what character they rolled, newer players may find it more difficult, especially if they ended up with a 
							below average character. Additionally, most enemies in the <a href="./gm-guide.html">GM guide</a> are balanced 
							around the idea that characters will have a base of 60 AP.</p>
						<p>Note that AP (as well as most other types of points) can only be changed when the character is created, or 
							during level-up events, which usually require a full rest.</p>
			</article>
			
			<article>
				<h2 id="AP-Modifiers">Attribute Modifiers</h2>
					<p>Modifiers are calculated based on the attribute most relevant to the roll. An attribute score of 10 is 
						considered average, resulting in no modifiers to rolls based on that attribute. If a character has an 
						attribute score lower than 10, they will have a negative modifier to those rolls, while an attribute 
						higher than 10 will grant a bonus to those rolls.</p>
					<p>The formula for calculating your modifier is:</p>
					<div class="Highlight">
						<h2>modifier = ( attribute - 10 ) / 2</h2>
					</div>
					<p><b>Note:</b> Only integer values are valid for modifier calculations. A result of less than 1 is always <i>
							rounded down</i> to the nearest full number.</p>
					<p>E.g. if a character has an attribute value of 11, their modifier is (11-10)/2=0.5 => 0.</p>
			</article>
			
			<article>
				<h3 id="Constitution">Constitution</h3>
					<p>Constitution (CON) is a measure of a character's toughness, and their ability to withstand damage. The most 
						direct way to represent this is with the number of Health Points (HP) the character has:</p>
					<div class="Highlight">
						<h2>maxHP = Constitution * Lv</h2>
					</div>
					<p>Based on this formula, you can see that maxHP increases with higher values of Constitution, as well as 
						the character level itself. As such, a character with high Constitution will continue to gain larger amounts of 
						maxHP per level-up than one with low Constitution.</p>
					<p>Constitution also affects Physical Resistance (PR), which further helps your character withstand damage. The 
						PR modifier works the same as the regular CON modifier, except that it does not have negative values, even if 
						your Constitutionis less than 10.</p>
					<div class="Highlight">
						<article>
							<h5>If CON < 0:</h5>
							<h2>PR = 0</h2>
						</article>
						<article>
							<h5>If CON >= 0:</h5>
							<h2>PR = CON</h2>
						</article>
					</div>
					<p>Please refer to the damage calculation guide below for further details on PR.</p>
					<p>The Endurance and Resistance abilities are also based on Constitution.</p>
			</article>
			
			<article>
				<h3 id="Strength">Strength</h3>
					<p>Strength (STR) is a measure of the physical force that a character can exert. One of its largest benefits is 
						its effect on Melee Damage (MD), which will cause your melee attacks to hit harder. Just as PR does not 
						have negative values, MD also does not decrease a damage roll's (dmg) result.</p>
					<div class="Highlight">
						<article>
							<h5>If STR < 0:</h5>
									<h2>MD = 0</h2>
						</article>
						<article>
							<h5>If STR >= 0:</h5>
							<h2>MD = STR</h2>
						</article>
					</div>
					<p>Please refer to the damage calculation guide below for further details on MD.</p>
					<p>Strength also affects the Athletics, Grappling and Intimidation abilities.</p>
			</article>
			
			<article>
				<h3 id="Dexterity">Dexterity</h3>
					<p>Dexterity (DEX) is a measure of agility and flexibility. A character with a high Dexterity attribute 
						is better able to perform jumps and other complicated maneuvers, avoid or disable traps, and may even 
						be able to dodge incoming attacks entirely.</p>
					<p>Dodge Value (DV), which allows characters to completely avoid attacks, is calculated similar to other 
						modifiers, however, it scales only half as rapidly:</p>
					<div class="Highlight">
						<h2>DV = ( DEX - 10 ) / 4</h2>
					</div>
					<p>It is important to note that DV does not make a character invulnerable: Area damage, such as an exploding 
						fireball, a cloud of poison, a collapsing wall, or a shockwave from an artillery shell, applies directly, 
						without any chance to dodge. In such cases, the GM may call for a Reflex or Resistance save to reduce the 
						damage, but DV itself will not come into play.</p>
					<p>Dexterity also affects the Acrobatics, Reflex, Stealth and Thievery abilities.</p>
			</article>
			
			<article>
				<h3 id="Intelligence">Intelligence</h3>
					<p>Intelligence (INT) represents a character's ability to use their mind through their Mana Points (MP):</p>
					<div class="Highlight">
						<h2>maxMP = Intelligence * Lv</h2>
					</div>
					<p>As you can see, the formula is the same as the formula for maxHP, except instead of using Constitution as 
						a base, MP are based on INT. As MP are needed to use active abilities, this means that characters with a high 
						Intelligence attribute will be able to use their active abilities more often than those with low Intelligence.</p>
					<p>Intelligence also comes into play as a form of roleplay immersion. For instance, an NPC with a low Intelligence 
						attribute is less likely to use advanced combat tactics than one with high Intelligence. Many players also enjoy 
						roleplaying these details, as it creates a fun atmosphere for everyone.</p>
					<p>The abilities based on Intelligence focus more on roleplaying than on pure combat stats, through Crafting, 
						History, Investigation, and Mindfulness. However, a smart player can still use this attribute to create a powerful 
						character.</p>
					</p>
			</article>
			
			<article>
				<h3 id="Wisdom">Wisdom</h3>
					<p>Wisdom (WIS) represents a character's attunement with the world around them, including magic. Most magic based 
						abilities use the WIS modifier to enhance magical damage rolls, and a high Wisdom attribute also improves magical 
						reisitance (MR) to defend against enemy spells. The formula is very similar to that for PR:</p>
					<div class="Highlight">
						<article>
							<h5>If WIS < 0:</h5>
							<h2>MR = 0</h2>
						</article>
						<article>
							<h5>If WIS >= 0:</h5>
							<h2>MR = WIS</h2>
						</article>
					</div>
					<p>Therefore, a character with a Wisdom attribute of 12, would automatically have an MR value of +1. Please refer to 
						the damage calculation guide below for further details on MR.</p>
					<p>Wisdom further affects the ability rolls for Intuition, Perception, Survival and Willpower.</p>
			</article>
			
			<article>
				<h3 id="Charisma">Charisma</h3>
					<p>Charisma (CHA) is the attribute least applicable to combat, but that does not make it any weaker than the other 
						attributes. A character with high Charisma benefits from significant advantages during roleplay elements of a game, 
						including the potential to avoid combat altogether. Meanwhile, a character with a particularly low Charisma score 
						may find themselves unfortunately vulnerable to spells that affect the mind, which range from card tricks and other 
						small illusions to game-changing charms or mind-controls. Nevertheless, Charisma remains one of the subtler 
						attributes.</p>
					<p>Groups who do not enjoy the haggling experience in their games can also use the CHA modifier to quickly calculate 
						discounts when their characters visit merchants to purchase items:</p>
					<div class="Highlight">
						<article>
							<h5>When Purchasing:</h5>
							<h2><section>Purchase Price</section><section>=</section><section>Armory Price * ( 1.5 - ( CHA / 50 ) ) * Local 
								Supply Modifier</section></h2>
						</article>
						<article>
							<h5>When Selling:</h5>
							<h2><section>Selling Price</section><section>=</section><section>Armory Price * ( 0.5 + ( CHA / 50 ) ) * Local 
								Supply Modifier</section></h2>
						</article>
					</div>
					<p>The Inspiration, Leadership, Performance, and Persuasion abilities are based on Charisma.</p>
			</article>
			
			<article>
				<h1 id="Background-Points">Background Points</h1>
					<p>Background Points (BP) are what makes your character unique. These points can be spent to acquire powerful abilities 
						that will define your PC and their playstyle throughout the entire game.</p>
					<p>While not strictly required, HammRPG recommends writing a backstory for your PC first, and only then creating 
						abilities that make sense within that backstory. Characters whose abilities are strongly intertwined with their 
						backstories tend to be more interesting from a role-play perspective, which improves immersion for yourself as well 
						as everyone else at the table.</p>
					<p>Please refer to the <a href="./creation.html">Character Creation</a> guide as well as the <a href="./abilities.html">
						Ability Creation</a> guide, and talk to your GM to create your own custom abilities.</p>
			</article>
			
			<article>
				<h1 id="Skill-Points">Skill Points</h1>
					<p>Skill Points (SP) are very similar to BP, except that they are less powerful. For instance, a single BP could grant 
						your character a +5 bonus for a given ability, while a SP would only grant a +1.</p>
					<p>The biggest advantage of SP over BP is that you get a lot more of them, which allows you to diversify your PC much 
						more. Additionally, SP are designed to be a more fluid representation of your PC's current abilities, rather than a 
						fixed picture of their background. As a result, most GMs will make it much easier to change SP abilities than BP 
						abilities (see PP section below).</p>
					<p>The two most common types of abilities are proficiencies, which provide a bonus to ability or attack rolls (atk), 
						and active abilities, which use MP to achieve much stronger bonuses to certain individual Actions alone.</p>
					<p>Please refer to the <a href="./creation.html">Character Creation</a> guide as well as the <a href="./abilities.html">
						Ability Creation</a> guide, and talk to your GM to create your own custom abilities.</p>
			</article>
			
			<article>
				<h1 id="Encounters">Encounters</h1>
					<p>While outside of combat situations, your character is able to do essentially anything you can think of. When 
						an encounter starts, the GM will typically describe the situation first, then the players have an opportunity 
						to interact with that situation. Depending on what the players choose to do, the GM will then ask for appropriate 
						ability rolls to determine how well your character actually performs what you described, or respond from the 
						perspective of the NPCs the players interacted with, etc. The result of the roll, or the result of the role-play 
						then leads to certain consequences as described by the GM. This back-and-forth between describing, rolling and 
						interacting is the essence of HammRPG.</p>
					<p>As such, while not in combat, actions and abilities are relatively fluid and intuitive, rather than closely 
						defined. Nevertheless, you can find a general description of each of the <a href="javascript:void(0);" 
						onclick="scrolltoSection('Abilities')">Abilities</a> below.</p>
					<p>However, if a situation escalates into combat, time becomes a much more significant factor. This is where 
						HammRPG uses a turn-based combat system to slow down time in order to allow players (and the GM) to think about 
						their next move, describe their attacks or other Actions in epic detail, and still banter between each other 
						without the stress of real-time combat.</p>
					
				<h2 id="Dice-Rolling">Dice Rolling</h2>
					<p>Many of the actions described below are resolved by rolling dice. In such cases, HammRPG uses the XdX notation 
						style:</p>
					<div class="Highlight">
						<h2># of Dice + "d" + Type of Dice</h2>
					</div>
					<p>For example, one twenty-sided die is written as 1d20, three twelve-sided dice would be 3d12, etc.</p>
					<p>Normally, a roll consists of a single instance of rolling the appropriate dice, and then adding the appropriate 
						modifiers to the roll. However, in some instances a roll may be rolled with Disadvantage, or Advantage, which 
						means that we:</p>
					<div class="Highlight">
						<article>
							<h5>If Disadvantage</h5>
									<h2>roll twice and take the lower number</h2>
						</article>
						<article>
							<h5>If Advantage</h5>
							<h2>roll twice and take the higher number</h2>
						</article>
					</div>
					<p>The instances of disadvantage or advantage stack, which means that if there are multiple sources of advantage 
						or disadvantage, the number of total dice rolled also increases. Likewise, advantage and disadvantage cancel 
						each other out.</p>
					<p>For example, let's say our PC has a situation where they need to make a roll with 4 sources of Advantage and 
						2 sources of Disadvantage: Two of the advantage-disadvantage pair cancel each other out, and we are left with 
						2 instances of Advantage. As a result, we roll 3 dice (1 base, plus 1 for each instance of advantage), and 
						then take the highest resulting number.</p>
					<p>Any applicable modifiers are only applied after the roll itself, including advantage-disadvantage 
						considerations, have been completed.</p>
			</article>

			<article>
				<h2 id="Abilities">Abilities</h2>
					<p>All characters have acccess to the same set of basic Abilities, which are influenced by the most appropriate 
						<a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="scrolltoSection('Attributes')">Attribute</a>:</p>

					<h3 id="Endurance">Endurance</h3>
						<p>Endurance is a character's cardio. In essence, how long can an effort be sustained before you run out of 
							steam. While there is no specific combat-Action based on Endurance, your GM can ask you for an Endurance roll 
							if you perform repeated <a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="scrolltoSection('Sprint-Action')">Sprinting</a> 
							attempts or other strenuous tasks.</p>
						<p>Endurance can also be used to help calculate travel times for long distance trips, etc.</p>

					<h3 id="Resistance">Resistance</h3>
						<p>Resistance is one of the less-used abilities. Generally, it applies as a save against hostile attempts to 
							affect your character, such as Grappling attempts or attacks that attempt to stun your character.</p>
						<p>Some GMs also like to use the Resistance ability to reduce the potency of certain effects, such as poisons, 
							but this is up to the GM and should be discussed during your group's <a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick=
							"scrolltoSection('Session-Zero')">Session Zero</a>.</p>

					<h3 id="Athletics">Athletics</h3>
						<p>Athletics is a measure of the direct physical force a character's body can muster on short notice. Trying to 
							push a heavy object, lift a rock, or compete in an arm-wrestling match are all typical examples that would 
							warrant an Athletics roll.</p>
						<p id="Sprint-Action">In combat, the most common Athletics check you will see is the Sprint Action:</p>
						<p>A Sprint Action is an attempt to gain additional Movement so that you can move across the battlefield more 
							quickly, or run away from an overpowering enemy. If you spend a combat-Action to try to sprint:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>less than 0 => no bonus Movement (the Action is still spent, though!)</li>
							<li>0 to 9 => +1 m of Movement</li>
							<li>10 to 19 => +2 m of Movement</li>
							<li>20 to 29 => +3 m of Movement</li>
							<li>etc.</li>
						</ul>
				
					<h3 id="Grappling">Grappling</h3>
						<p>Grappling is an attempt to hold an enemy down, preventing them from moving and using Actions freely. This 
							can be done to protect your allies, prevent an enemy from running away, or simply to stop a spellcaster from 
							casting. Grappling is almost exclusively a combat action, which means if you attempt it in a non-combat 
							encounter, it will usually turn into a combat encounter.</p>
						<p>First, the initiating grappler rolls their atk roll, which is a Grappling ability roll with Unarmed Proficiency. 
							The resulting number is then compared to the target's DV to see if the target simply dodges the attack 
							altogether. Finally, if the target does not dodge, the defender also rolls a Grappling roll to determine 
							who gains control in the struggle. The initial Grappling attempt does not deal any damage.</p>
						<p>If the attacker gains control, the Grapple is maintained, and the attacker continues their turn. 
							If the defender gains control, they may choose to immediately let go of the Grapple, or maintain 
							it as is. Regardless of who gains control, <i>both</i> contestants gain the <b>Grappled</b> 
							effect as long as the Grapple is maintained.</p>
						<p>While grappled, the contestants can only perform the following Actions (rolling with disadvantage unless 
							they are in control of the contest):</p>
						<ul>
							<li><u>Gain Control</u>: The character performing this Action simply re-rolls their Grappling attempt. The 
								DC for this is calculated according to the normal DC formula, based on the opponent's most recent Grappling 
								roll. This Action can also be used to improve already existing control of a Grappling contest; however, it 
								does not deal any damage.</li>
							<li><u>Shove Action</u>: The initiator rolls Athletics, while the defender rolls Resistance. The winner may 
								then dictate up to 1 m of movement for each 5 points of lead in the contest. For example, if the 
								contest results are 5 vs 18, the character that rolled the 18 can move both characters by up to 2 
								m each ((18 - 5) / 5 = 2). Such Movment is only possible if the winner actually has the necessary 
								Movement available, but the looser's Movement is ignored within this context.</li>
							<li>Unarmed Attack</li>
							<li>Intimidation Action</li>
							<li>Pickpocket Action</li>
							<li>Knowledge Check</li>
							<li>Intuition Check</li>
							<li>Perception Check</li>
							<li>Inspiration Action</li>
							<li>Distraction Action</li>
						</ul>
				
					<h3 id="Intimidation">Intimidation</h3>
						<p>An Intimidation Action is an attempt to frighten the enemy, which is represented by the <b>Feared</b> 
							effect when in combat. It functions similar to the Grappling contest, except that the initiator rolls Intimidation, 
							while the target rolls Leadership as a measure of their level of discipline.</p>
						<p>Intimidation is usually specific to the one target, but can in some cases also apply to a group of targets. 
							In such situations, the GM will ususally increase the DC based on how many targets are around. In other words, 
							the more allies a target has around them, the higher their chance of resisting an Intimidation attempt.</p>

					<h3 id="Acrobatics">Acrobatics</h3>
						<p>Acrobatics represents a character's general agility.</p>
						<p id="Jump-Action">In many instances, a character may need to perform a Jump Action, for example to cross a 
							chasm, to avoid triggering a pressure plate trap, etc.:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>less than 0 => the jump critically fails, which may mean the PC falls into the chasm, triggers the trap, 
								etc. without the opportunity to try to save the situation</li>
							<li>0 to 4 => the jump fails, but the PC may roll a Reflex save to stop themselves. The DC for the save is 
								20 - the existing Acrobatics roll</li>
							<li>5 to 9 => the jump clears up to 1 m</li>
							<li>10 to 14 => the jump clears up to 2 m</li>
							<li>15 to 19 => the jump clears up to 3 m</li>
							<li>20 to 24 => the jump clears up to 4 m</li>
							<li>25 to 29 => the jump clears up to 5 m</li>
							<li>etc.</li>
						</ul>
						<p>Note that the Jump distance <b>does</b> count towards your Movement when you are in combat. In other words, 
							if your PC has only 3 tiles of Movement left, they can only jump up to 3 tiles, even if they roll a wicked 
							Acrobatics check (let's say a 42 or something like that).</p>

					<h3 id="Disengage-Action">Disengage Action (Reflex)</h3>
						<p>In many situations, retreat may be the most viable strategy. Disengaging represents an attempt to leave an 
							enemy's melee range, but as you will see in the <a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="scrolltoSection(
							'Attack-of-Opportunity')">Attack of Opportunity</a> section, this gives them a potential opportunity to 
							attack you even though it is not their turn. A disengage is your attempt to avoid this attack, by spending 
							an Action of your own to contest the enemy's atk with your Reflex ability, giving you a second chance to 
							get away from the enemy.</p>
				
					<h3 id="Sneak-Action">Sneak Action (Stealth)</h3>
						<p>Sneaking represents an attempt to prevent an enemy from knowing where you are or what you are doing. While, 
							mathematically, this is represented by a simple ability check, the actual chance of success is much more 
							complicated:</p>
						<p>At minimum, you will likely have to break line-of-sight, and reduce the noises you make. You'll have to 
							carefully examine the battlemap and decide where you want to position yourself, and then move as little as 
							possible.</p>
						<p>Unfortunately, your GM will most likely not tell you if your attempt at stealth is successful or not until 
							the consequences are already self-evident...</p>
						<p>If you manage to stay hidden, the first attack you make from stealth counts as a Sneak Attack, which means 
							the dmg roll for the atk will be multiplied by 2.</p>
						<div class="Highlight">
							<h2>Successful Sneak Attack = dmg *2</h2>
						</div>

					<h3 id="Pickpocket-Action">Pickpocket Action (Thievery)</h3>
						<p>As a combat action, pickpocketing represents an attempt to manipulate your enemy's inventory. This can be 
							straightforward as grabbing a key from their belt, or as subtle as switching one of their healing potions 
							for a poison flask from your own inventory. Obviously, if the enemy has already spotted you, the DC for the 
							attempt will be higher, but distractions in the form of Grappling or Performance rolls can sometimes help 
							you achieve success.</p>
						<p>For obvious reasons, this action can only be performed if you are in melee range of your target.</p>

					<h3 id="Knowledge-Check">Knowledge Check (History)</h3>
						<p>A History check is essential when special enemy types appear on the battlefield. Certain enemies will either 
							be immune to certain damage types, or may even be healed or strengthened by them instead. Think of a fire 
							elemental, for example. Not only does it not care about you waving a torch in its face, but stoking its flames 
							would actually make it stronger.</p>
						<p>The History check is therefore there to try to find out what the enemy may be vulnerable to, or resistant 
							against.</p>

					<h3 id="Targeting-Action">Targeting Action (Investigation)</h3>
						<p>Taking a second to pick your target's weak spot is useful, especially if your enemy has not seen you yet. 
							It essentially sacrifices one action in order to make the next attack stronger:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>less than 0 => no bonus</li>
							<li>0 to 4 => +1 atk and +2 dmg</li>
							<li>5 to 9 => +2 atk and +4 dmg</li>
							<li>10 to 14 => +3 atk and +6 dmg</li>
							<li>15 to 19 => +4 atk and +8 dmg</li>
							<li>20 to 24 => +5 atk and +10 dmg</li>
							<li>25 to 29 => +6 atk and +12 dmg</li>
						</ul>

					<h3 id="Intuition-Check">Intuition Check</h3>
						<p>If you're stuck and not really sure what to do, you can also use an Intuition check to essentaily ask your 
							GM for some hints. A Knowledge check can only give you information that your PC would reasonably know based 
							on their backstory and previous encounters, but a good Intuition check might allow you to infer brand new 
							conclusions.</p>

					<h3 id="Perception-Check">Perception Check</h3>
						<p>This is a quick physical check of your surroundings. If you suspect that there might be enemies in hiding, 
							waiting to ambush you, or if you think an area might be trapped, it may be a good idea to spend an Action 
							just making sure you have a good lay of the land before charging in.</p>
						<p>As for all abilities, if you do not make a specific roll, your Passive Perception is 0 + your modifiers. In 
							other words, even if you get the lowest possible roll on your ability check, you will get more information 
							than simply waiting for the GM to tell you what's happening. Some GMs will wait for you to ask them for a 
							Perception check, rather than potentially giving you a hint that there might be something hidden by asking 
							you for it.</p>

					<h3 id="Inspiration-Action">Inspiration Action</h3>
						<p>If you have a very critical roll coming up, you can spnd an Action to psych yourself up for it. This is 
							very similar to the <a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="scrolltoSection('Targeting-Action')">
							Targeting Action</a> for atk rolls, but for ability checks. Note that the bonuses are reduced:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>less than 0 => no bonus</li>
							<li>0 to 9 => +1 next ability roll</li>
							<li>10 to 19 => +2 next ability roll</li>
							<li>20 to 29 => +3 next ability roll</li>
						</ul>
						<p>You will also roll Inspiration every time you spend a <a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="scrolltoSection(
							'Party-Point')">Party Point</a> on yourself, although in that case it does not cost you an Action.</p>

					<h3 id="Help-Others-Action">Help Others Action (Leadership)</h3>
						<p>In the same spirit as the <a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="scrolltoSection('Inspiration-Action')">
							Inspiration Action</a>, you can also spend an Action to help one of your allies. These bonuses are higher, 
							though, especially if you roll well:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>less than 0 => no bonus</li>
							<li>0 to 4 => +1</li>
							<li>5 to 9 => +2</li>
							<li>10 to 14 => +3</li>
							<li>15 to 19 => +4</li>
							<li>20 to 24 => +5</li>
							<li>25 to 29 => +6</li>
						</ul>
						<p>When you spend <a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="scrolltoSection('Party-Point')">Party Points</a> on 
							your allies instead of yourself, you will also be able to use the Leadership roll instead of the Inspiration 
							roll.</p>

					<h3 id="Distraction-Action">Distraction Action (Performance)</h3>
						<p>This is essentially the opposite of a <a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="scrolltoSection('Sneak-Action')">
						Sneak Action</a>, and can be used to help take the attention away from your allies so that they can perform a 
						critical task more safely, or to lure enemies into a trap. The GM will determine the DC of the roll based on the 
						specific context, including your role-play for the distraction.</p>

			<article>
				<h2 id="Combat">Combat</h2>
					<p>The following sections are specific to combat encounters; however, this is not an exhaustive list. In many cases, 
						your GM will have to make a situation-specific ruling, which then supercedes the rules described here.</p>

					<h3 id="Initiative">Initiative</h3>
						<p>In order to determine who gets to go first during turn based combat, HammRPG uses Initiative rolls, which is 
							essentially a simple Reflex ability roll.</p>
						<div class="Highlight">
							<h2>Initiative = Reflex roll = 1d20 + Reflex modifier</h2>
						</div>
						<p>Some groups prefer to utilize individual initiatives, while others prefer to allow all PCs to play their turn 
							at the same time, and then play all the NPC's turn at the same time. Group initiative makes cooperation easier 
							for groups who prefer it, and may speed up combat in online text-only campaigns, while individual initiative 
							tends to make for cleaner combat if players like to lean heavily into roleplay, as well as for high level groups.
							This is a matter of preference and will be discussed during the <a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick=
							"scrolltoSection('Session-Zero')">Session Zero</a> before the campaign starts.</p>

					<h3 id="Movement">Movement</h3>
						<p>At Lv1, each player has 5 m of Movement per turn.</p>
						<p>Unless otherwise specified, <b>HammRPG considers 1 tile on a given battlemap to be 1 meter (m) by 1 m</b> 
							in size, for simplicity. However, additional Movement can be purchased with BP or SP, as outlined in the 
							<a href="./creation.html">Character Creation Guide</a> and the <a href="./abilities.html">Ability Creation 
								Guide</a></p>

					<h3 id="Actions">Actions</h3>
						<p>An Action is a basic activity that a player performs. Swinging a sword at an enemy is one of the simplest 
							examples of this, but there are several basic Actions that every character can perform even without 
							purchasing these Actions with BP or SP. Please refer to the <a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick=
							"scrolltoSection('Abilities')">Abilities List</a> for specific descriptions on how your Abilities can be 
							used in a combat encounter.</p>
						<p>By default, each character has 1 Action, and can purchase more with SP or BP. Some GMs also 
							grant additional Actions at certain levels, just to increase the speed of combat encounters and allow players 
							to feel more powerful.</p>

					<h3 id="Reactions">Reactions</h3>
						<p>A Reaction is very similar to an <a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="scrolltoSection('Action')">Action</a>, 
							except that it is something you can do when it is not your turn. The only default Reaction is the <a href=
							"javascript:void(0);" onclick="scrolltoSection('AOO')">Attack of Opportunity</a>.</p>
						<p>By default, each character has 1 Reaction, and can purchase more with SP or BP.</p>
				
					<h3 id="Melee-Attack">Melee Attack Action</h3>
						<p>The attack Action is the most basic Action in combat encounters. You can either just use your hands 
							or feet or you can use an equipped weapon. Your specific selection of possible attack Actions will depend 
							on the skills and items your PC has available. All melee attack Actions are rolled with a 1d20, plus any 
							bonuses from your character's proficiencies, or the weapon's own modifiers, where the final result 
							represents the attack roll (atk).</p>
						<div class="Highlight">
							<h2>atk = 1d20 + Proficiencies + Weapon Modifiers</h2>
						</div>
						<p>The result of atk is then compared to the target's DV; If atk is equal to or higher than the DV, the 
							attack is successful, and you move on to the damage calculations, which will be explained in detail further 
							below, or apply the appropriate effects. The type and number of dice to use for the dmg roll depends on 
							what attack Action you performed.</p>
						<p>For instance, an unarmed attack uses the unarmed proficiency for atk and a 1d4 damage die. If this is 
							a melee attack, it also benefits from the MD modifier. Similarly, a Steel Shortsword uses sword proficiency, 
							but it also provides a bonus of +1 for atk due to its own design, as well as a 1d6+MD for dmg.</p>
						<p>The <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1QkFdJyOYmSCuLDvVvT-ryOK-unPjXyxaJk77vcSobVA/edit?usp=
							sharing">Armory</a> contains a list of commonly available items with their roll modifiers and other 
							important stats.</p>

						<h4 id="Melee-Failure">Melee Attack Failure:</h4>
							<p>There are no special considerations, as the attack likely just swings through the air. Some GMs like 
								to apply immersive consequences on a nat1 (hit yourself, hit a nearby ally, drop your weapon, etc.), 
								but this is optional and should be discussed during the <a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick=
								"scrolltoSection('Session-Zero')">Session Zero</a> for your game.</p>
					
					<h3 id="Damage-Calculation">Damage Calculation</h3>
							<p>If an attack successfully hits the target, the next step is to determine how hard the hit lands. The 
								Damage Roll (dmg) dice are usually determined by the specific weapons being used. A default unarmed attack 
								uses 1d4 dice, while a particularly good weapon may have 2d12 or even larger dice. Additionally, some 
								weapons provide intrinsic modifiers to the damage dice as well, as detailed in either the <a href="https:
								//docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1QkFdJyOYmSCuLDvVvT-ryOK-unPjXyxaJk77vcSobVA/edit?usp=sharing">Armory</a> 
								or the item's specific stats.</p>
							<p>All melee attacks also benefit from the MD modifier, which is based on the character's Strength, as 
								well as MD proficiency:</p>
							<div class="Highlight Side-by-Side">
								<article>
									<p>Melee Attack:</p>
									<h2>dmg = XdX + Item Modifiers + MD</h2>
								</article>
								<article>
									<p>Ranged Attack</p>
									<h2>dmg = XdX + Item Modifiers</h2>
								</article>
							</div>
							<p>However, different people experience pain differently, and an unarmored character will suffer much more 
								than one in heavy plate armor. This concept is represented by the character's PR and MR stats. As such, 
								we need to determine if the attack was physical or magical in nature, and the subtract the appropriate 
								modifer from the dmg:</p>
							<div class="Highlight Side-by-Side">
								<article>
									<p>Physical dmg:</p>
									<h2>actual HP loss = dmg - PR</h2>
								</article>
								<article>
									<p>Magical dmg</p>
									<h2>actual HP loss = dmg - MR</h2>
								</article>
							</div>
							<p>Note that these modifiers can never reduce your actual HP loss below 1. If an attack hits you, but the dmg 
								is lower than your PR/MR, you will always suffer at least 1 point of HP loss.</p>

					<h3 id="Ranged-Attack">Ranged Attack Action</h3>
						<p>If you cammot reach your enemy, you can still try to attack them by throwing objects (rocks, bottles, 
							alchemical flasks, chairs, etc.), or using ranged weapons such as bows, crossbows, guns, etc. The damage 
							calculation for ranged weapons is idential to the <a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="scrolltoSection(
							'Damage-Calculation')">Damage Calculation</a> for melee weapons, except that ranged weapons do not by default 
							benefit from the MD modifier.</p>
						<p>One important thing to keep in mind with virtually all ranged weapons, is ammunition; you can only 
							shoot an arrow if you actually have an arrow to shoot. Some improvised items, such as rocks, might be 
							available in your surroundings, or you can carry such ammunition with you in your inventory. It is up to you, 
							the player, to ensure that you keep track of ammunition for your PC.</p>
						<p>Additionally, characters can use <a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="scrolltoSection('Cover')">
							Cover</a> to help avoid ranged attacks</p>

						<h4 id="Ranged-Weapon">Ranged Weapon Attacks</h4>
							<p>Most specialized ranged attack tools have their own unique effective ranges. For example, when using a 
								shortbow from the <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1QkFdJyOYmSCuLDvVvT-ryOK-unPjXyxaJk77
								vcSobVA/edit?usp=sharing">Armory</a>, we can see that the standard range is 40 m, while the maximum 
								range is up to 400 m. This means that, when attacking a target that is within 40 m of our character, we 
								simply roll atk with proficiencies. However, if the target is in the long range, we must roll atk with 
								disadvantage, which scales based on the standard range.</p>
							<p>In our example above, this means that for every 40 m, we need to consider an additional instance of 
								disadvantage. Up to 40 m we roll a single die (no disadvantage), between 40 m and 80 m we roll two dice 
								and take the lower result (disadvantage), between 80 m and 120 m we roll three dice and take the lowest 
								result (double disadvantage), then between 120 m and 160 m we roll 4 dice and take the lowest result 
								(triple disadvantage), etc.</p>
							<p>The maximum range indicates the absoulte maximum at which a shot can be attempted, although in many 
								instances, it is probably not practical to actually try to make a shot at that range due to the scaling 
								disadvantage consideration.</p>
							<div class="Highlight Side-by-Side">
								<article>
									<p>Standard Range</p>
									<h2>Single atk roll + proficiency modifiers</h2>
								</article>
								<article>
									<p>Long Range</p>
									<h2>+1 instance of disadvantage per multiplier of the standard range number</h2>
								</article>
							</div>

						<h4 id="Ranged-Throwing">Ranged Throwing Attacks</h4>
							<p>Throwing, on the other hand, is more a feature of the skill of the thrower, as there is no tool being 
								used. As such, throwing is handled through a combined atk/ability roll - in other words, an atk roll 
								that also benefits from the ability modifier:</p>
							<div class="Highlight Side-by-Side">
								<article>
									<p>When throwing for impact damage:<br>(e.g.: rock or spear throw)</p>
									<h2>Athletics roll, where DC = range</h2>
								</article>
								<article>
									<p>When throwing for targeting precision:<br>(e.g.: poison flask, distracting noise)</p>
									<h2>Acrobatics roll, where DC = range</h2>
								</article>
							</div>
							<p>As such throwing does not have an inherent maximum range, but rather your character's skills determine 
								how far they can realistically throw. A beneficial side effect of this method is that both your Throwing 
								proficiency and your Athletics or Acrobatics proficiency applies, which makes throwing a potentially very 
								powerful combat method at early levels.</p>
							<p>Regardless of the range of a throw though, the target's DV still applies, and a throwing attack will miss 
								if it is lower than the target's DV, even if it is higher than the DC needed for the throw.</p>

						<h4 id="Ranged-Failure">Ranged Failure Handling</h4>
							<p>When a melee attack fails, it most likely simply swings through the air, which we can easily ignore. 
								However, once a ranged projectile has been fired or thrown, it might still hit something else, even 
								if it misses its intended target. Particularly, projectiles that deal area damage, such as flasks 
								of poison that shatter on impact and release a poison cloud, or exploding artillery shells, are 
								important in this context.</p>
							<p>We can therefore have to consider targeting accuracy when a ranged attack fails. If the attack misses: </p>
							<div class="Highlight Side-by-Side">
								<article>
									<p>For ranged <u>weapon</u> attacks:</p>
									<h2>Offset = (range to target / default range ) * ( DV - atk )</h2>
								</article>
								<article>
									<p>For ranged <u>throw</u> attacks:</p>
									<h2>Offset = DC - atk</h2>
								</article>
							</div>
							<p>You can then roll a 1d8 to determine in which direction the projectlie missed. A 1 would mean the 
								projectile lands north of the target, 2 northeast, 3 east, etc.</p>
							<p>Note that this system is rather complicated, and it is entirely reasonable to simply have the GM make an 
								on the spot ruling on where the projectile landed based on how bad the atk roll was. For non-area damage 
								or effect causing ranged attacks, a miss can simply be a miss without figuring out where else the 
								projectile goes.</p>

						<h4 id="Cover">Cover</h4>
							<p>Another optional system for ranged weapons is the effect blocking projectiles by utilizing cover.</p>
							<p>Different blocking objects provide different levels of protection:</p>
							<ul>
								<li>Light Cover (heavy foliage, picket fence, light post, etc.): +2 DV</li>
								<li>Medium Cover (wooden wall, storage crates, etc.): +5 DV</li>
								<li>Heavy Cover (stone wall, metal plate objects, etc.): +10 to DV</li>
								<li>Complete Cover: Ranged attacks are not possible</li>
							</ul>
							<p>Note that peeking out from cover, for example in order to make a ranged attack yourself, reduces the 
								effect of whatever cover you are using by 50%. Additionally, it is not possible to peek out from 
								complete cover.</p>
