				<h1>The HammRPG Concept</h1>
				<p>HammRPG is a tabletop roleplaying game (TTRPG) that allows players to collectively create and narrate a story 
					together. One player takes on the role of the Game Master (GM), who drives the story forward and plays all the 
					non-player characters (NPCs). The other players create their own player characters (PCs) and work together with 
					the GM to tell a unique and exciting story.</p>
				<p>HammRPG is a collaborative storytelling game. This means that the GM and players all work together to create 
					a story through cooperation and teamwork. No one player is more important than the others and everyone has a 
					say in how the story unfolds by roleplaying their PC's choices, actions, and conversations. The more you immerse 
					yourself into your character and try to think and act from their perspective, the more fun everyone will have. 
					That being said, keep in mind that the player behind the character is always more important that the character or 
					the even the story itself!</p>
				<p>The main concept that sets HammRPG apart from other TTRPGs is its focus on customizability. Where some games may 
					have you choose certain abilities from a pre-made list of possible features, HammRPG allows each player to create 
					their own entirely customized abilities from scratch. Your character can be as synergized or ramshackled as you 
					like, providing for a virtually infinitely complex combination of character features and roleplay opportunities. 
					In order ensure all players have the same opportunity to shine, we recommend using the <a href="./abilities.html">
					Ability</a> guide to create your custom abilities. This will enable you to plan how your PC will develop over time, 
					and might also provide some ideas for balancing, as well as ideas for abilities you may not have thought of.</p>
				<p>The below rules section is designed to help players create a fun and engaging storytelling experience. It provides 
					a framework for resolving conflicts, handling challenges, and advancing the story in a way that is hopefully fair 
					to everyone at the table. However, it's important to remember that the rules are not meant to be restrictive - 
					the group should always feel free to adapt the rules as needed to best serve their specific story.</p>
