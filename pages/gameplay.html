				<h1 id="Concept">The HammRPG Concept</h1>
					<p>HammRPG is a tabletop roleplaying game (TTRPG) that allows players to collectively create and narrate a story 
						together. One player takes on the role of the Game Master (GM), who drives the story forward and plays all the 
						non-player characters (NPCs), while the other players create their own player characters (PCs) and work together 
						with the GM to tell a unique and exciting story.</p>
					<p>HammRPG is a collaborative storytelling game. This means that the GM and players all work together to create 
						a story through cooperation and teamwork. No one player is more important than the others and everyone has a 
						say in how the story unfolds by roleplaying their PC's choices, actions, and conversations. The more you immerse 
						yourself into your character and try to think and act from their perspective, the more fun everyone will have. 
						That being said, keep in mind that the player behind the character is always more important than the character or 
						the even the story itself!</p>
					<p>The main concept that sets HammRPG apart from other TTRPGs is its focus on customizability. Where some games may 
						have you choose certain abilities from a pre-made list of possible features, HammRPG allows each player to create 
						their own entirely customized abilities from scratch. Your character can be as synergized or ramshackled as you 
						like, providing for a virtually infinitely complex combination of character features and roleplay opportunities. 
						In order ensure all players have the same opportunity to shine, we recommend using the <a href="./skillcreation.html">
						Skill Creation Guide</a> to create your custom abilities. This will enable you to plan how your PC will develop 
						over time, helps with balancing, and might also provide some ideas for abilities you may not have thought of.</p>
					<p>The below rules section is designed to help players create a fun and engaging storytelling experience. It provides 
						a framework for resolving conflicts, handling challenges, and advancing the story in a way that is hopefully fair 
						to everyone at the table. However, it's important to remember that the rules are not meant to be restrictive - 
						the group should always feel free to adapt the rules as needed to best serve their specific story.</p>

				<h1 id="Encounters">Encounters</h1>
					<p>While outside of combat situations, your character is able to do essentially anything you can think of. When 
						an encounter starts, the GM will typically describe the situation first, then the players have an opportunity 
						to interact with that situation. Depending on what the players choose to do, the GM will then ask for appropriate 
						ability rolls to determine how well your character actually performs what you described, or respond from the 
						perspective of the NPCs the players interacted with, etc. The result of the roll, or the result of the role-play 
						then leads to certain consequences as described by the GM. This back-and-forth between describing, rolling and 
						interacting is the essence of HammRPG.</p>
					<p>As such, while not in combat, actions and abilities are relatively fluid and intuitive, rather than closely 
						defined. Nevertheless, you can find a general description of each of the <a href="./gameplay-abilities.html">
						Abilities</a> below.</p>
					<p>However, if a situation escalates into combat, time becomes a much more significant factor. This is where 
						HammRPG uses a turn-based combat system to slow down time in order to allow players (and the GM) to think about 
						their next move, describe their attacks or other Actions in epic detail, and still banter between each other 
						without the stress of real-time combat.</p>

				<h2 id="Dice-Rolling">Dice Rolling</h2>
					<p>Many of the actions described below are resolved by rolling dice. In such cases, HammRPG uses the XdX notation 
						style:</p>
					<div class="Highlight">
						<h2># of Dice + "d" + Type of Dice</h2>
					</div>
					<p>For example, one twenty-sided die is written as 1d20, three twelve-sided dice would be 3d12, etc.</p>
					<p>Normally, a roll consists of a single instance of rolling the appropriate dice, and then adding the appropriate 
						modifiers to the roll. However, in some instances a roll may be rolled with Disadvantage, or Advantage, which 
						means that we:</p>
					<div class="Highlight">
						<article>
							<h5>If Disadvantage</h5>
									<h2>roll twice and take the lower number</h2>
						</article>
						<article>
							<h5>If Advantage</h5>
							<h2>roll twice and take the higher number</h2>
						</article>
					</div>
					<p>The instances of disadvantage or advantage stack, which means that if there are multiple sources of advantage 
						or disadvantage, the number of total dice rolled also increases. Likewise, advantage and disadvantage cancel 
						each other out.</p>
					<p>For example, let's say our PC has a situation where they need to make a roll with 4 sources of Advantage and 
						2 sources of Disadvantage: Two of the advantage-disadvantage pair cancel each other out, and we are left with 
						2 instances of Advantage. As a result, we roll 3 dice (1 base, plus 1 for each instance of advantage), and 
						then take the highest resulting number.</p>
					<p>Any applicable modifiers are only applied after the roll itself, including advantage-disadvantage 
						considerations, have been completed.</p>

					<h3 id="Nat1">Critical Fails</h3>
						<p>Rolling a natural 1 (nat1) constitutes a critical failure. While ability rolls are still compared in the 
							same way they always are, atk rolls that result in a nat1 miss regardless of the actual DV value of the 
							target. For example, if your target has a DV of 2, and you roll a nat1+5 => 6, the attack is still 
							considered a miss, since it was a critical failure.</p>
						<p>As an <b>optional</b> mechanic, some GMs also like to implement other consequences, such as accidentally 
							hitting yourself, dropping your weapon, or falling to the ground, however, this should be discussed during 
							your group's Session Zero.</p>

					<h3 id="Nat20">Critical Successes</h3>
						<p>Just as a nat1 is considered a critical fail, a natural 20 (nat20) is considered a critical success. 
							However, as a bonus, the number resulting from a nat20 is multiplied by 2 (e.g.:Nat20 +2 = 44).</p>
						<p>For atk rolls, a nat20 constitutes a guaranteed hit, thus giving you a chance to hit even enemies with 
							very high DV values (although such high DV values are extremely rare in HammRPG). Additionally, the 
							corresponding dmg roll is multiplied by 2. Note that different instances of critical hits <b>DO</b> 
							stack, meaning that a nat20 on a successful Sneak Attack would multiply the corresponding dmg roll 
							x2 x2 => x4. You can have as many sources of critical hits as your GM is comfortable running.</p>
						<p>Again, some GMs enjoy applying contextual bonuses such as knocking the enemy's weapon from their hand, 
							cutting off an arm entirely, etc., however, this should be discussed during the Session Zero for your 
							game.</p>
						<p>As an optional mechanic that has received very positive feedback, we have also created the <a 
							href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="scrolltoSection('PP')">PP</a> mechanic.</p>
					
			</article>

				<h2 id="PP">PP</h2>
					<p>Participation Points, Party Points, Power Points - whatever you choose to call them, PP are designed 
						to emulate the luck and influence of a character beyond simple dice rolling, as well as give the player 
						a direct way to affect critical in-game events.</p>
					<p>Since this mechanic influences the game on a quite high level, it can be immersion breaking for many 
						players. As such, it <b>must</b> be discussed before the game starts, and the decision about this mechanic 
						should be <i>unanimous</i>. PP are collected separately for each PC, and may not be transferred from one 
						character to another.</p>
					<p>There are several ways to obtain PP:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>When you roll a nat20, you gain 1 PP</li>
						<li>After critical in-game moments, such as final boss fights or similarly important encounters, the GM 
							may assign up to 5 PP to the player that delivered the killing blow, or otherwise decicively resolved the 
							encounter. To encourage teamwork, at least 3 of these PP <b>must</b> be distributed among the rest of the 
							team.</li>
						<li>Particularly immersive and thoughtful roleplay, or contextually epic moments, can be awarded with PP 
							at the GM's discretion. Players are encouraged to point out potential moments, but in order to avoid 
							'PP farming', all such moments must be approved by the GM.</li>
					</ul>
					<p>There is no theoretical limit to how many PP a PC can store; however, the powerful boosts that PP can 
						bestow make it rare for a character to gather large amounts of PP. Let's see some examples:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>When you make an ability roll (i.e.: not atk or dmg rolls), you can spend 1 PP to grant your PC a 1d4 
							Inspiration bonus. Since this counts as an Inspiration roll, you can also make an Inspiration ability 
							roll and add the resulting bonus to the 1d4. You can spend any number of PP on your own rolls in this way
							 - if you have them.</li>
						<li>When an ally makes an ability roll (i.e.: not atk or dmg rolls), you can spend a Reaction to grant 1 PP 
							to that ally as a 1d6 Leadership bonus. Since this roll utilizes the Leadership ability, it benefits from 
							a potentially higher bonus, but helping allies in this way is limited not only by the number of PP you have, 
							but also by the number of Reactions you have available at the time of the roll.</li>
						<li>At the beginning of an encounter, you can use some PP to learn critical information about your enemies 
							(vulnerabilities, immunities, etc.), at a cost of 1 PP per piece of intel.</li>
						<li>Similarly, at the beginning of an encounter, you can spend 3 PP to change a piece of terrain on a battle-
							map, such as insert a window into a wall, place a few bushes near the alley you want to sneak in, etc. 
							Do note, however, that such changes may affect how the GM planned the encounter, such as guard posts, 
							patrol routes, etc, so your GM may increase the cost of the specific change you request, as well as take 
							some time to actually implement the requested change.</li>
						<li>During a level-up event, you can spend PP reassign or adjust your skills. Changing an SP ability costs 
							1 PP per SP changed, while changing BP costs 5 PP per BP. This simply reflects that BP define who your 
							character is, while SP represent what your PC is currently able to do. Additionally, this allows you to 
							adjust abilities that turn out to be less useful than you envisioned without excessive penalty.</li>
						<li>During any full rest, you can spend PP to permanently improve your item's stats. This represents the fact 
							that your PC is getting accustomed to using that particular item, thus making it more effective for that PC. 
							In other words, the upgrade applies to the item when the PC that upgraded it uses it, but it does not 
							apply the upgrades when any other character uses it, which means it does not increase the value of the item 
							for anyone else. The cost for such upgrades is highly dependent on what you're trying to do, but here are a 
							few examples: 5 PP could improve your sword with a +1 to atk rolls, or add +1 PR to an armor item. 10 PP can 
							even upgrade the damage dice by two points, for example bringing it from 1d8 to 1d10, or from 2d12 to 2d14. 
							Adding additional dice, such as going from 1d6 to 2d6 is much more expensive, though, at 20PP. You can 
							request almost any change, and your GM will then tell you if they are comfortable running that change, as 
							well as the PP cost.</li>
						<li>If you have any other special requests for your GM, such as resurrecting a character that died, etc., 
							you can try to use PP to try to barter for it. However, ultimately each GM sets their own boundaries for 
							their game, and players and GMs will all have certain lines they will not cross. Many such things can 
							and should be discussed during the Session Zero for your specific game. PP are not intended as a way to 
							bully the GM, and "No!" is a perfectly valid response to your request. Please refer to the Adventurer's 
							Code before you make any special requests.</li>
