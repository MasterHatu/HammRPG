				<h1>Status Effects</h1>
				<p>Sometimes characters will be affected by certain status effects. In this article, the character causing the 
					effect will be referred to as the Source, while the character experiencing the effect will be called the Target.</p>
				<p>Typically, the Source will make an atk roll, and then the Target makes the appropriate save. The effect is 
					applied if the Source wins the contest.</p>
				<p>Once the effect is applied, it remains until the Target makes a successful save, which can be re-attempted 
					at the beginning of each Target turn. For each turn after the effect is first applied, the original atk roll 
					decays by 1 point, meaning that it gets easier to shake off negative effects as time goes on.</p>
				<div class="Highlight">
					<h2>DC = atk - (# of Turns since atk)</h2>
				</div>
				<p>For example, if a Source rolled a 15 on their initial atk rolls, the Target needs to beat the 15 during the 
					first turn to resist the effect. During the second turn, the Target only needs to beat the 14, then the 13 
					during the third turn, etc.</p>
				<p>In most cases the effect wears of on its own according to the formula described above, but in some cases it can 
					also be removed by performing specific actions, as specified in the effect list below.</p>
			</div>
			<h2>Status:</h2>
			<div class="Item-Card">
				<h3>Dead</h3>
				<p>The Target is dead and can no longer be controlled by the player.</p>
				<p>While there are many rituals and spells that can revive a dead character, only the character's allies
					can perform these. It is also possible to use PP (either from the deceased character or from your new character) 
					to 'get special favors from the GM', such as bringing back fallen PCs.</p>
				<p>Regardless of how your character is revived, the GM will apply a contextual penalty to the PC, which 
					can only be removed with additional PP</p>
			</div>
			<div class="Item-Card">
				<h3>Unconscious</h3>
				<p>An unconscious character is unable to move or perform any actions. All enemy attacks against an unconscious 
					character roll with advantage, but instead of dealing HP damage, they apply a failed death save.</p>
				<p>This effect is removed if the Target receives any healing, or successfully resolves their death saves.</p>
			</div>
			<h2>Debuffs:</h2>
			<div class="Item-Card">
				<h3>Blinded</h3>
				<p>The Target automatically fails all vision based Perception checks. The Target must roll all melee attacks
				with disadvantage, and all ranged attacks with <i>disadvantage as well as a -10 modifier</i>. Additionally,
				the Target rolls all Grappling, Intimidation, Acrobatics, Reflex, Thievery, Crafting, Investigation,
				Perception, and Performance checks at disadvantage.</p>
				<p>This effect can be removed if the Target receives more than two times its own Constitution value in HP 
					healing within a single turn.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="Item-Card">
				<h3>Deafened</h3>
				<p>The Target automatically fails all sound based Perception checks and ignores all sound based communication. 
					The Target must roll all Stealth, Investigation, Intuition, and Survival checks at disadvantage. Additionally, 
					the Target is unable to gain any benefits from allied Leadership or Performance based abilities 
					(including PP assistance).</p>
				<p>This effect can be removed if the Target receives more than its own Constitution value in HP healing within 
					a single turn.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="Item-Card">
				<h3>Fatigued - Stage I</h3>
				<p>Disadvantage on all Ability rolls.</p>
				<h3>Fatigued - Stage II</h3>
				<p>Disadvantage on all Ability and atk rolls.</p>
				<h3>Fatigued - Stage III</h3>
				<p>Disadvantage on <i>all</i> rolls (including dmg rolls), and Movement is reduced by 50%.</p>
				<p>Fatigue can be gained by not not resting for 20+Endurance consecutive hours, falling unconscious, or through certain 
					direct spell effects. It can be removed only by resting, at a rate of 1 Stage per 10 hours of rest.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="Item-Card">
				<h3>Intimidated</h3>
				<p>The Target is unable to move closer to the Source at any point during their turn, and must make all rolls 
					against the Source with disadvantage.</p>
				<p>This effect can be removed if the Source falls unconscious, if the Target looses the ability to perceive the Source 
					for 1 full turn (most commonly by breaking line-of-sight), or if the Target uses an Action contest the 
					Intimidation with a successful Inspiration check.</p>
			</div>
			<h2>Control over Others:</h2>
			<div class="Item-Card">
				<h3>Charmed</h3>
				<p>The Source may use an Action to give a command to the Target. The Target must follow the command to 
					the best of their ability until a new command is issued, except if following the command directly 
					harms the Target (i.e., you can't tell your Target to jump off a cliff or fall on their sword).</p>
				<p>This effect decays at 2x the normal rate => DC = atk - 2x(# of Turns since atk).</p>
			</div>
			<div class="Item-Card">
				<h3>Controlled</h3>
				<p>The Source may use an Action to give a command to the Target. The Target must follow the command to
					the best of their ability until a new command is issued, <i>even if the command directly	harms the 
					Target</i>.</p>
				<p>This effect decays at 5x the normal rate => DC = atk - 5x(# of Turns since atk).</p>
			</div>
			<div class="Item-Card">
				<h3>Grappled</h3>
				<p>The Source and Target can both only perform unarmed melee attacks (no Mana abilities), 
					or shove movements.</p>
				<p>A shove movement is an Action that only exists within a Grappling contest. The initiator rolls Athletics, 
					while the defender rolls Resistance. The winner may then dictate up to 1 tile of movement for each 5 
					points of lead in the contest. For example, if the contest results are 5 vs 18, the character 
					that rolled the 18 can move both characters by up to 2 tiles each ((18 - 5) / 5 = 2). Such movment is only 
					possible if the winner actually has the necessary Movement available.</p>
				<p>The effect ends when the winner of the most recent grappling contest chooses to let go, or when 
					one of the two characters falls unconscious.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="Item-Card">
				<h3>Taunted</h3>
				<p>The Target is forced to attack the Source using basic attacks only (no Mana abilities).</p>
				<p>The duration of this effect is always strictly limited in the Ability description, and the Target can 
					also attempt to break free each turn using the standard formula.</p>
