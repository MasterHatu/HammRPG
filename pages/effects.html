				<h1>Status Effects</h1>
				<p>Sometimes characters will be affected by certain status effects. In this article, the character causing the 
					effect will be referred to as the <span class="Character">Source</span>, while the character experiencing the 
					effect will be called the <span class="Character">Target</span>.</p>
				<p>Typically, the <span class="Character">Source</span> will make an <span class="rolls">atk</span> roll, and then 
					the <span class="Character">Target</span> makes the appropriate save. The effect is applied if the <span 
					class="Character">Source</span> wins the contest.</p>
				<p>Once the effect is applied, it remains until the <span class="Character">Target</span> makes a successful save,
					which can be re-attempted at the beginning of each <span class="Character">Target</span> turn. For each turn after
					the effect is first applied, the original atk roll decays by 1 point, meaning that it gets easier to shake off
					negative effects as time goes on.</p>
				<div class="Highlight">
					<h2>DC = atk - (# of Turns since atk)</h2>
				</div>
				<p>For example, if a <span class="Character">Source</span> rolled a 15 on their initial atk rolls, the <span
					class="Character">Target</span> needs to beat the 15 during the first turn to resist the effect. During the second
					turn, the <span class="Character">Target</span> only needs to beat the 14, then the 13 during the third turn, etc.</p>
				<p>In most cases the effect wears of on its own according to the formula described above, but in some cases it can 
					also be removed by performing specific actions, as specified in the effect list below.</p>
				<h2>Debuffs</h2>
			</div>
			<div class="Item-Card">
				<h3>Blinded</h3>
				<p>The <span class="Character">Target</span> automatically fails all vision based <span class="Ability">
					Perception</span> checks. The <span class="Character">Target</span> must roll all <span class="Melee">
					melee</span> attacks with disadvantage, and all <span class="Ranged">ranged</span> attacks with disadvantage 
					as well as a -10 modifier. Additionally, the <span class="Character">Target</span> rolls all <span 
					class="Ability">Grappling</span>, <span class="Ability">Intimidation</span>, <span class="Ability">
					Acrobatics</span>, <span class="Ability">Reflex</span>, <span class="Ability">Thievery</span>, <span 
					class="Ability">Crafting</span>, <span class="Ability">Investigation</span>, <span class="Ability">
					Perception</span>, and <span class="Ability">Performance</span> checks at disadvantage.</p>
				<p>This effect can be removed if the <span class="Character">Target</span> receives more than two times 
					its own <span class="Attribute">Constitution</span> value in HP within a single turn.</p>
			</div>
			<h2>Control over others</h2>
			<div class="Item-Card">
				<h3>Taunted</h3>
				<p>The <span class="Character">Target</span> is forced to attack the <span class="Character">Source</span> 
					using basic attacks only (no Mana abilities).</p>
				<p>This effect is always limited based on the <span class="Ability">Ability</span> used.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="Item-Card">
				<h3>Charmed</h3>
				<p>The <span class="Character">Source</span> may use an Action to give a command to the <span 
					class="Character">Target</span>. The <span class="Character">Target</span> must follow the command to 
					the best of their ability until a new command is issued, except if following the command directly 
					harms the <span class="Character">Target</span> (i.e., you can't tell your <span class="Character">
					Target</span> to jump off a cliff or fall on their sword).</p>
				<p>This effect decays at 2x the normal rate => DC = atk - 2x(# of Turns since atk).</p>
			</div>
			<div class="Item-Card">
				<h3>Controlled</h3>
				<p>The <span class="Character">Source</span> may use an Action to give a command to the <span
					class="Character">Target</span>. The <span class="Character">Target</span> must follow the command to
					the best of their ability until a new command is issued, <i>even if the command directly	harms the 
					<span class="Character">Target</span></i>.</p>
				<p>This effect decays at 5x the normal rate => DC = atk - 5x(# of Turns since atk).</p>
