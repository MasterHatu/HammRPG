				<h1>Status Effects</h1>
				<p>Sometimes characters will be affected by certain status effects. In this article, the character causing the 
					effect will be referred to as the Source, while the character experiencing the effect will be called the Target.</p>
				<p>Typically, the Source will make an atk roll, and then the Target makes the appropriate save. The effect is 
					applied if the Source wins the contest.</p>
				<p>Once the effect is applied, it remains until the Target makes a successful save, which can be re-attempted 
					at the beginning of each Target turn. For each turn after the effect is first applied, the original atk roll 
					decays by 1 point, meaning that it gets easier to shake off negative effects as time goes on.</p>
				<div class="Highlight">
					<h2>DC = atk - (# of Turns since atk)</h2>
				</div>
				<p>For example, if a Source rolled a 15 on their initial atk rolls, the Target needs to beat the 15 during the 
					first turn to resist the effect. During the second turn, the Target only needs to beat the 14, then the 13 
					during the third turn, etc.</p>
				<p>In some cases, the effect can also be removed by performing specific actions, as specified below.</p>
			</div>
			<h2>Status:</h2>
			<div class="Item-Card">
				<h3>Dead</h3>
				<p>The Target is dead and can no longer be controlled by the player.</p>
				<p>While there are many rituals and spells that can revive a dead character, only the character's allies
					can perform these. It is also possible to use PP (either from the deceased character or from your new character) 
					to 'get special favors from the GM', such as bringing back fallen PCs.</p>
				<p>Regardless of how your character is revived, the GM will apply a contextual penalty to the PC, which 
					can only be removed with additional PP</p>
			</div>
			<div class="Item-Card">
				<h3>Unconscious</h3>
				<p>An unconscious character is unable to move or perform any actions. All enemy attacks against an unconscious 
					character roll with advantage, but instead of dealing HP damage, they apply a failed death save.</p>
				<p>This effect is removed if the Target receives any healing, or successfully resolves their death saves.</p>
			</div>
			<h2>Buffs:</h2>
			<div class="Item-Card">
				<h3>Hidden</h3>
				<p>A hidden character has not been seen, heard or otherwise perceived (yet?). You will typically not know if 
					your Stealth attempt was successful or not, but no matter what your actual roll was, remember that 
					<i>your PC believes that they are hidden</i>.</p>
				<p>This effect ends when the Target performs any Action or Reaction that another character is able 
					to perceive. If the Action that breaks the effect is an atk action, it <i>may</i> deal 2x damage.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="Item-Card">
				<h3>Invisible</h3>
				<p>The Target cannot be seen, except with the help of visual tools (such as a cloud of dust), or magical spells 
					(such as Reveal, True Sight, etc.). However, the target can still be perceived by other means (heat signature, 
					sound, etc.), so the Hidden effect is not guaranteed.</p>
				<p>This effect typically ends after a set duration, and a character can only obtain Invisibility once per turn.</p>
			</div>
			<h2>Debuffs:</h2>
			<div class="Item-Card">
				<h3>Blinded</h3>
				<p>The Target automatically fails all vision based Perception checks. The Target must roll all melee attacks
				with disadvantage, and all ranged attacks with <i>disadvantage as well as a -10 modifier</i>. Additionally,
				the Target rolls all Grappling, Intimidation, Acrobatics, Reflex, Thievery, Crafting, Investigation,
				Perception, and Performance checks at disadvantage.</p>
				<p>This effect can be removed if the Target receives more than 2x its own Constitution value in HP 
					healing within a single turn.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="Item-Card">
				<h3>Deafened</h3>
				<p>The Target automatically fails all sound based Perception checks and ignores all sound based communication. 
					The Target must roll all Stealth, Investigation, Intuition, and Survival checks at disadvantage. Additionally, 
					the Target is unable to gain any benefits from allied Leadership or Performance based abilities 
					(including PP assistance).</p>
				<p>This effect can be removed if the Target receives more than 1x its own Constitution value in HP healing within 
					a single turn.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="Item-Card">
				<h3>Fatigued - Stage I</h3>
				<p>Disadvantage on all Ability rolls.</p>
				<h3>Fatigued - Stage II</h3>
				<p>Disadvantage on all Ability and atk rolls.</p>
				<h3>Fatigued - Stage III</h3>
				<p>Disadvantage on <i>all</i> rolls (including dmg rolls), and Movement is reduced by 50%.</p>
				<p>Fatigue can be gained by not not resting for 20+Endurance consecutive hours, falling unconscious, or through certain 
					direct spell effects. It can be removed only by resting, at a rate of 1 Stage per 10 hours of rest.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="Item-Card">
				<h3>Intimidated</h3>
				<p>The Target is unable to move closer to the Source at any point during their turn, and must make all rolls 
					against the Source with disadvantage.</p>
				<p>This effect can be removed if the Source falls unconscious, if the Target looses the ability to perceive the Source 
					for 1 full turn (most commonly by breaking line-of-sight), or if the Target uses an Action contest the 
					Intimidation with a successful Inspiration check.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="Item-Card">
				<h3>Petrified</h3>
				<p>The Target solidifies and turns to stone. Its stats become that of a stone statue: DV: 0, PR: 100, MR:100, 
					Actions: 0, Reactions: M0, and Movement: 0. Additionally, it gains 100% immunity to poison and disease damage.</p>
				<p>This effect can only be removed if the Target receives more than 10x its own Constitution value in HP
					healing within a single turn.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="Item-Card">
				<h3>Prone</h3>
				<p>The Target is laying on the ground and rolls all CON, STR, DEX, and CHA based rolls, as well as atk and 
					melee dmg rolls at disadvantage. However, atk rolls with two-handed rifle-style gunpowder weapons roll with 
					advantage instead. All enemies also gain advantage on their melee atk and dmg rolls against the Target.</p>
				<p>This effect can be removed if the Target stands up, which costs 1 Action or 3 Movement, and provokes AOOs.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="Item-Card">
				<h3>Stunned</h3>
				<p>The Target is unable to move or perform and Actions or Reactions for the duration of the effect. All enemies roll 
					all atk and dmg rolls against the Target with advantage.</p>
				<p>The duration of this effect is always strictly limited in the Ability description, and the Target can
				also attempt to break free each turn using the standard formula.</p>
			</div>
			<h2>Control over Others:</h2>
			<div class="Item-Card">
				<h3>Charmed</h3>
				<p>The Source may use an Action to give a command to the Target. The Target must follow the command to 
					the best of their ability until a new command is issued, except if following the command directly 
					harms the Target (i.e., you can't tell your Target to jump off a cliff or fall on their sword).</p>
				<p>This effect decays at 2x the normal rate => DC = atk - 2x(# of Turns since atk).</p>
			</div>
			<div class="Item-Card">
				<h3>Controlled</h3>
				<p>The Source may use an Action to give a command to the Target. The Target must follow the command to
					the best of their ability until a new command is issued, <i>even if the command directly	harms the 
					Target</i>.</p>
				<p>This effect decays at 5x the normal rate => DC = atk - 5x(# of Turns since atk).</p>
			</div>
			<div class="Item-Card">
				<h3>Grappled</h3>
				<p>The Source and Target can both only perform the following Actions: Gain Control, Shove, Unarmed 
					Attack, Intimidation Action, Pickpocket Action, Knowledge Check, Intuition Check, Perception 
					Check, Inspiration Action, and Distraction Action. It is not possible to use Mana abilities while 
					Grappled.</p>
				<p>The effect ends when the winner of the most recent grappling contest chooses to let go, or when 
					one of the two characters falls unconscious.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="Item-Card">
				<h3>Restrained</h3>
				<p>The Target is only able to move as far as the specific restraints allow, and makes all CHA based rolls at 
					disadvantage.</p>
				<p>This effect cannot be removed without removing the item causing it.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="Item-Card">
				<h3>Taunted</h3>
				<p>The Target is forced to attack the Source using basic attacks only (no Mana abilities).</p>
				<p>The duration of this effect is always strictly limited in the Ability description, and the Target can 
					also attempt to break free each turn using the standard formula.</p>
