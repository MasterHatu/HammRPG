				<h2 id="Combat">Combat</h2>
					<p>The following sections are specific to combat encounters; however, this is not an exhaustive list. In many cases, 
						your GM will have to make a situation-specific ruling, which then supercedes the rules described here.</p>

					<h3 id="Initiative">Initiative</h3>
						<p>In order to determine who gets to go first during turn based combat, HammRPG uses Initiative rolls, which is 
							essentially a simple Reflex ability roll.</p>
						<div class="Highlight">
							<h2>Initiative = Reflex roll = 1d20 + Reflex modifier</h2>
						</div>
						<p>Some groups prefer to utilize individual initiatives, while others prefer to allow all PCs to play their turn 
							at the same time, and then play all the NPC's turn at the same time. Group initiative makes cooperation easier 
							for groups who prefer it, and may speed up combat in online text-only campaigns, while individual initiative 
							tends to make for cleaner combat if players like to lean heavily into roleplay, as well as for high level groups.
							This is a matter of preference and will be discussed during the <a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick=
							"scrolltoSection('Session-Zero')">Session Zero</a> before the campaign starts.</p>

					<h3 id="Movement">Movement</h3>
						<p>At Lv1, each player has 5 m of Movement per turn.</p>
						<p>Unless otherwise specified, <b>HammRPG considers 1 tile on a given battlemap to be 1 meter (m) by 1 m</b> 
							in size, for simplicity. However, additional Movement can be purchased with BP or SP, as outlined in the 
							<a href="./creation.html">Character Creation Guide</a> and the <a href="./skillcreation.html">Skill Creation 
								Guide</a>.</p>

					<h3 id="Actions">Actions</h3>
						<p>An Action is a basic activity that a player performs. Swinging a sword at an enemy is one of the simplest 
							examples of this, but there are several basic Actions that every character can perform even without 
							purchasing these Actions with BP or SP. Please refer to the <a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick=
							"scrolltoSection('Abilities')">Abilities List</a> for specific descriptions on how your Abilities can be 
							used in a combat encounter.</p>
						<p>By default, each character has 1 Action, and can purchase more with SP or BP. Some GMs also 
							grant additional Actions at certain levels, just to increase the speed of combat encounters and allow players 
							to feel more powerful.</p>

					<h3 id="Reactions">Reactions</h3>
						<p>A Reaction is very similar to an <a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="scrolltoSection('Action')">Action</a>, 
							except that it is something you can do when it is not your turn. The only default Reaction is the <a href=
							"javascript:void(0);" onclick="scrolltoSection('AOO')">Attack of Opportunity</a>.</p>
						<p>By default, each character has 1 Reaction, and can purchase more with SP or BP.</p>
				
					<h3 id="Melee-Attack">Melee Attack Action</h3>
						<p>The attack Action is the most basic Action in combat encounters. You can either just use your hands 
							or feet or you can use an equipped weapon. Your specific selection of possible attack Actions will depend 
							on the skills and items your PC has available. All melee attack Actions are rolled with a 1d20, plus any 
							bonuses from your character's proficiencies, or the weapon's own modifiers, where the final result 
							represents the attack roll (atk).</p>
						<div class="Highlight">
							<h2>atk = 1d20 + Proficiencies + Weapon Modifiers</h2>
						</div>
						<p>The result of atk is then compared to the target's DV; If atk is equal to or higher than the DV, the 
							attack is successful, and you move on to the damage calculations, which will be explained in detail further 
							below, or apply the appropriate effects. The type and number of dice to use for the dmg roll depends on 
							what attack Action you performed.</p>
						<p>For instance, an unarmed attack uses the unarmed proficiency for atk and a 1d4 damage die. If this is 
							a melee attack, it also benefits from the MD modifier. Similarly, a Steel Shortsword uses sword proficiency, 
							but it also provides a bonus of +1 for atk due to its own design, as well as a 1d6+MD for dmg.</p>
						<p>The <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1QkFdJyOYmSCuLDvVvT-ryOK-unPjXyxaJk77vcSobVA/edit?usp=
							sharing">Armory</a> contains a list of commonly available items with their roll modifiers and other 
							important stats.</p>

						<h4 id="Melee-Failure">Melee Attack Failure:</h4>
							<p>There are no special considerations, as the attack likely just swings through the air. Some GMs like 
								to apply immersive consequences on a nat1 (hit yourself, hit a nearby ally, drop your weapon, etc.), 
								but this is optional and should be discussed during the <a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick=
								"scrolltoSection('Session-Zero')">Session Zero</a> for your game.</p>
					
					<h3 id="Damage-Calculation">Damage Calculation</h3>
							<p>If an attack successfully hits the target, the next step is to determine how hard the hit lands. The 
								Damage Roll (dmg) dice are usually determined by the specific weapons being used. A default unarmed attack 
								uses 1d4 dice, while a particularly good weapon may have 2d12 or even larger dice. Additionally, some 
								weapons provide intrinsic modifiers to the damage dice as well, as detailed in either the <a href="https:
								//docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1QkFdJyOYmSCuLDvVvT-ryOK-unPjXyxaJk77vcSobVA/edit?usp=sharing">Armory</a> 
								or the item's specific stats.</p>
							<p>All melee attacks also benefit from the MD modifier, which is based on the character's Strength, as 
								well as MD proficiency:</p>
							<div class="Highlight Side-by-Side">
								<article>
									<p>Melee Attack:</p>
									<h2>dmg = XdX + Item Modifiers + MD</h2>
								</article>
								<article>
									<p>Ranged Attack</p>
									<h2>dmg = XdX + Item Modifiers</h2>
								</article>
							</div>
							<p>However, different people experience pain differently, and an unarmored character will suffer much more 
								than one in heavy plate armor. This concept is represented by the character's PR and MR stats. As such, 
								we need to determine if the attack was physical or magical in nature, and the subtract the appropriate 
								modifer from the dmg:</p>
							<div class="Highlight Side-by-Side">
								<article>
									<p>Physical dmg:</p>
									<h2>actual HP loss = dmg - PR</h2>
								</article>
								<article>
									<p>Magical dmg</p>
									<h2>actual HP loss = dmg - MR</h2>
								</article>
							</div>
							<p>Note that these modifiers can never reduce your actual HP loss below 1. If an attack hits you, but the dmg 
								is lower than your PR/MR, you will always suffer at least 1 point of HP loss.</p>

					<h3 id="Ranged-Attack">Ranged Attack Action</h3>
						<p>If you cammot reach your enemy, you can still try to attack them by throwing objects (rocks, bottles, 
							alchemical flasks, chairs, etc.), or using ranged weapons such as bows, crossbows, guns, etc. The damage 
							calculation for ranged weapons is idential to the <a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="scrolltoSection(
							'Damage-Calculation')">Damage Calculation</a> for melee weapons, except that ranged weapons do not by default 
							benefit from the MD modifier.</p>
						<p>One important thing to keep in mind with virtually all ranged weapons, is ammunition; you can only 
							shoot an arrow if you actually have an arrow to shoot. Some improvised items, such as rocks, might be 
							available in your surroundings, or you can carry such ammunition with you in your inventory. It is up to you, 
							the player, to ensure that you keep track of ammunition for your PC.</p>
						<p>Additionally, characters can use <a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="scrolltoSection('Cover')">
							Cover</a> to help avoid ranged attacks</p>

						<h4 id="Ranged-Weapon">Ranged Weapon Attacks</h4>
							<p>Most specialized ranged attack tools have their own unique effective ranges. For example, when using a 
								shortbow from the <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1QkFdJyOYmSCuLDvVvT-ryOK-unPjXyxaJk77
								vcSobVA/edit?usp=sharing">Armory</a>, we can see that the standard range is 40 m, while the maximum 
								range is up to 400 m. This means that, when attacking a target that is within 40 m of our character, we 
								simply roll atk with proficiencies. However, if the target is in the long range, we must roll atk with 
								disadvantage, which scales based on the standard range.</p>
							<p>In our example above, this means that for every 40 m, we need to consider an additional instance of 
								disadvantage. Up to 40 m we roll a single die (no disadvantage), between 40 m and 80 m we roll two dice 
								and take the lower result (disadvantage), between 80 m and 120 m we roll three dice and take the lowest 
								result (double disadvantage), then between 120 m and 160 m we roll 4 dice and take the lowest result 
								(triple disadvantage), etc.</p>
							<p>The maximum range indicates the absoulte maximum at which a shot can be attempted, although in many 
								instances, it is probably not practical to actually try to make a shot at that range due to the scaling 
								disadvantage consideration.</p>
							<div class="Highlight Side-by-Side">
								<article>
									<p>Standard Range</p>
									<h2>Single atk roll + proficiency modifiers</h2>
								</article>
								<article>
									<p>Long Range</p>
									<h2>+1 instance of disadvantage per multiplier of the standard range number</h2>
								</article>
							</div>

						<h4 id="Ranged-Throwing">Ranged Throwing Attacks</h4>
							<p>Throwing, on the other hand, is more a feature of the skill of the thrower, as there is no tool being 
								used. As such, throwing is handled through a combined atk/ability roll - in other words, an atk roll 
								that also benefits from the ability modifier:</p>
							<div class="Highlight Side-by-Side">
								<article>
									<p>When throwing for impact damage:<br>(e.g.: rock or spear throw)</p>
									<h2>Athletics roll, where DC = range</h2>
								</article>
								<article>
									<p>When throwing for targeting precision:<br>(e.g.: poison flask, distracting noise)</p>
									<h2>Acrobatics roll, where DC = range</h2>
								</article>
							</div>
							<p>As such throwing does not have an inherent maximum range, but rather your character's skills determine 
								how far they can realistically throw. A beneficial side effect of this method is that both your Throwing 
								proficiency and your Athletics or Acrobatics proficiency applies, which makes throwing a potentially very 
								powerful combat method at early levels.</p>
							<p>Regardless of the range of a throw though, the target's DV still applies, and a throwing attack will miss 
								if it is lower than the target's DV, even if it is higher than the DC needed for the throw.</p>

						<h4 id="Ranged-Failure">Ranged Failure Handling</h4>
							<p>When a melee attack fails, it most likely simply swings through the air, which we can easily ignore. 
								However, once a ranged projectile has been fired or thrown, it might still hit something else, even 
								if it misses its intended target. Particularly, projectiles that deal area damage, such as flasks 
								of poison that shatter on impact and release a poison cloud, or exploding artillery shells, are 
								important in this context.</p>
							<p>We can therefore have to consider targeting accuracy when a ranged attack fails. If the attack misses: </p>
							<div class="Highlight Side-by-Side">
								<article>
									<p>For ranged <u>weapon</u> attacks:</p>
									<h2>Offset = (range to target / default range ) * ( DV - atk )</h2>
								</article>
								<article>
									<p>For ranged <u>throw</u> attacks:</p>
									<h2>Offset = DC - atk</h2>
								</article>
							</div>
							<p>You can then roll a 1d8 to determine in which direction the projectlie missed. A 1 would mean the 
								projectile lands north of the target, 2 northeast, 3 east, etc.</p>
							<p>Note that this system is rather complicated, and it is entirely reasonable to simply have the GM make an 
								on the spot ruling on where the projectile landed based on how bad the atk roll was. For non-area damage 
								or effect causing ranged attacks, a miss can simply be a miss without figuring out where else the 
								projectile goes.</p>

						<h4 id="Cover">Cover</h4>
							<p>Another optional system for ranged weapons is the effect blocking projectiles by utilizing cover.</p>
							<p>Different blocking objects provide different levels of protection:</p>
							<ul>
								<li>Light Cover (heavy foliage, picket fence, light post, etc.): +2 DV</li>
								<li>Medium Cover (wooden wall, storage crates, etc.): +5 DV</li>
								<li>Heavy Cover (stone wall, metal plate objects, etc.): +10 to DV</li>
								<li>Complete Cover: Ranged attacks are not possible</li>
							</ul>
							<p>Note that peeking out from cover, for example in order to make a ranged attack yourself, reduces the 
								effect of whatever cover you are using by 50%. Additionally, it is not possible to peek out from 
								complete cover.</p>
					
					<h3 id="Held-Action">Holding an Action</h3>
						<p>In some instances, you may want to wait to perform an action until something specific happens. For 
							example, you might want to wait to attack the guard at the watchtower you're trying to take out until 
							your friend is in position to do the same for the second guard. Or you might want to wait to run around 
							the corner until the patrol turns around, or hold an attack action until a target comes into your 
							firing range.</p>
						<p>This is where the Held Action comes in:</p>
						<div class="Highlight Side-by-Side">
							<h2>Held Action = Reaction + Predetermined Action</h2>
						</div>
						<p>It is important to note that you need to have both an Action and a Reaction available to perform a 
							Held Action. As such, you can only hold as many Actions as you have Reactions available (and of course 
							you can only hold an Action if you actually have an Action available to hold). The Held Action is then 
							performed at the exact moment its trigger activates. In other words, the Held Action can transfer a 
							specific Action from your own turn to another character's turn, if that other character activates the 
							trigger.</p>
						<p>Let's say you are unable to get into firing range of your enemy during your turn. Rather than simply 
							giving up your Action for that turn entirely, you can assign a trigger to it, and then use your Reaction 
							to activate it once the trigger becomes true. In this example, the trigger would be 'the enemy comes 
							around the corner', and the Held Action could be 'I perform a Power Attack with my bow'.</p>
						<p>Of course, you can still choose not to go through with the Held Action even if the trigger does 
							become true.</p> 
						<p>Unfortunately, though, you cannot change your Held Action during your enemy's turn. So if 
							you specified that you will be making a Power Attack, you can only make a Power Attack, not a regular 
							attack, not the 360 No Scope Shot, not a Spinning Death Shot, or any of your other abilities - only 
							the exact Action that you Held, and only if your exact specified trigger becomes activated.</p>
						
					<h3 id="AOO">Attack of Opportunity</h3>
						<p>The Attack of Opportunity (AOO), is the most common Reaction in the game. Essentially, it represents a 
							zone of control that your character has.</p>
						<p>Since AOOs are Reactions, they happen when it is not your PC's turn. By default, AOOs trigger when:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>A hostile character performs a non-combat Action (e.g.: standing up, channeling a spell, etc.), 
								while within your PC's melee range.</li>
							<li>If your PC is using one-handed weapons, they can perform an AOO when an enemy <i><b>leaves</b></i> 
								their melee range.</li>
							<li>If your PC is using two-handed weapons, they can perform an AOO when an enemy <i><b>enters</b></i> 
								their melee range.</li>
						</ul>
						<p>It is not possible to use Mana consuming active abilities on an AOO (unless you have spent BP/SP to 
							change this, as per <a href="./skillcreation.html">Skill Creation Guide</a>).</p>
						
				<h2 id="Skills">Non-Magical Skills</h2>
					<p>Non-magical skills you create are typically activated directly and all at once. This means that when you 
						use the skill, the effect happens immediately. For damage skills, the additional damage from the skill is 
						simply added to your dmg roll; for skills that attempt to apply an effect to the enemy, the contest is rolled 
						immediately; etc.</p>
					<p>The only major considerations for such skills are range, which can be either Melee or Ranged, and damage 
						type. If the skill is a Melee skill, it cannot be used to enhance a ranged attack, and vice versa. The damage 
						type is important to determine if PR or MR apply, and also if any of the characters have vulnerabilities or 
						resistances.</p>
					<p>Non-magical skills can only be performed exactly as defined. In other words, if you have a skill called
						Power Shot at skill level 2, which adds 2d8+2 pdmg to your ranged attack against a single target, it will
						always add 2d8+2 pdmg to your ranged attack against a single target.</p>
					<p>The <a href="./skillcreation.html">Skill Creation Guide</a> has a few example skills, and also shows you how 
						to balance them.</p>

				<h2 id="Magic">Magic</h2>
					<p>Most fantasy worlds involve some element of magic. How common this is, and the specific implementation
						of magical skills and such, is up to the specific GM running the campaign you are in.</p>
					<p>Since HammRPG is loosely based on the Warhammer Fantasy universe, we have attempted to create a system that
						involves references to the Winds of Magic, the immense powers that magic can bestow, but also the balancing
						factor of the energies of Chaos that seek to corrupt particularly those who overuse magic.</p>

					<h3 id="Channeling">Magical Channeling</h3>
						<p>Magical spells, on the other hand, are more fluid since they ebb and flow according to the winds of magic, 
							which is represented by the <i><b>optional</b></i> mechanic of channeling. However, overcasting spells in 
							this way carries a risk of Mutation - a fate far worse than a simple critical fail.</p>
						<p>For each turn you channel, the spell level (SPLv) increases by 1, even above your own PC Lv.</p>
						<div class="Highlight Side-by-Side">
							<article>
								<p>Channeling:</p>
								<h2>Spell Level = starting spell level + number of turn of the channel (n)</h2>
							</article>
						</div>
						<p>This leads to several major advantages of channeling:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>You can reduce the amount of Mana you spend, by spending time (and risk) instead</li>
							<li>You can change the specific behavior of the higher SPLv (see example)</li>
							<li>You can up-cast the SPLv even higher than your own Character Lv</li>
						</ul>
						<p>However, channeling is not without cost: While channelling, a character is unable to Move, or perform 
							any other Actions or Reactions. If a channeling character suffers damage, they need to roll an 
							Endurance save that must be higher than the incoming damage number. If the roll is successful, the 
							channel continues, but if it fails, the spell is interrupted without refunding the Mana spent.</p>
						<p>Finally, a channeling wizard needs to make a Resistance save for every turn they decide to continue 
							the channel:</p>
						<div class="Highlight Side-by-Side">
							<article>
								<p>Resistance check:</p>
								<h2>DC = 20 - Winds of Magic - Character Lv + starting SPLv + n</h2>
							</article>
						</div>
						<p>Failing a channeling Resistance check bears one of the most severe punishments in the game: <a 
							href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="scrolltoSection('Mutations')">Mutations</a>.</p>

						<div class="Example">
							<h4>Example</h4>
							<p>(you may want to read about <a href="./skillcreation.html">Skill Creation</a> before you read on)</p>
							<p>Let's say your Lv4 PC has spent 4 SP to create a Fireball spell (ranged):</p>
							<ul>
								<li>SPLv1: 1d8+1 mdmg (fire) single target</li>
								<li>SPLv2: 2d8+2 mdmg (fire) single target</li>
								<li>SPLv3: 3d8+4 mdmg (fire) single target</li>
								<li>SPLv4: 3d8+5 mdmg (fire) single target, + 1d4+1 mdmg (area, fire) in a 3x3 area centered on that 
									target</li>
							</ul>
							<p>There are several ways to take advantage of channeling:</p>
							<ol>
								<li>When you cast the spell at Lv4, it normally costs 12 MP; however, if you start channeling the Lv1 
									version of the spell instead, and keep it up for 3 turns, it would only cost 3 MP (and 3 turns of 
									time).</li>
								<li>Notice that SPLv4 adds area damage. However, if there is only 1 target, you can instead channel 
									the Lv3 version of the spell for 1 turn, and then change it to a 4d8+5 mdmg (fire) version.</li>
								<li>The most powerful use of spell channeling is up-casting beyong your own character Lv: Normally, 
									the maximum level of a skill is your character Lv; however, by utilizing the channeling mechanic, 
									you can unlock this limit. There is no theoretical limit to this type of spell up-casting.</li>
							</ol>
							<p></p>
						</div>
					
					<h3 id="Rituals">Magical Rituals</h3>
						<p>Rituals are very rare and unusual types of magic. They may require some or all of the following:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>One or more wizards familiar with the specific lore of magic of the desired spell (a fire mage cannot 
								conjure a rainstorm, for example).</li>
							<li>A ritual location, typically ritual stones, magical runes, arrangements of candles, etc. Some locations, 
								such as wizard schools, temples, etc. may already have such arrangements.</li>
							<li>Specific ingredients, ranging from simply understanding the goal, to herbs or alchemical concoctions, 
								to even body parts (may or may not have to be yours...).</li>
							<li>A significant investment of time (hours or days, most likely).</li>
						</ul>
						<p>Because of these requirements, rituals are often major plot-points in a campaign, and are not part of 
							standard character creation. Please talk to your GM (ideally during Session Zero) about what kind of magic 
							they are comfortable running.</p>
						
				<h2 id="Mutations">Mutations</h2>
					<p>The lore of the Warhammer fantasy universe is filled with tales of corruption. Many children are born 
						with the mark of chaos, and some even choose to worship the chaos gods on their own.
