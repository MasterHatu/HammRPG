				<h2 id="Combat">Combat</h2>
					<p>The following sections are specific to combat encounters; however, this is not an exhaustive list. In many cases, 
						your GM will have to make a situation-specific ruling, which then supercedes the rules described here.</p>

					<h3 id="Initiative">Initiative</h3>
						<p>In order to determine who gets to go first during turn based combat, HammRPG uses Initiative rolls, which is 
							essentially a simple Reflex ability roll.</p>
						<div class="Highlight">
							<h2>Initiative = Reflex roll = 1d20 + Reflex modifier</h2>
						</div>
						<p>Some groups prefer to utilize individual initiatives, while others prefer to allow all PCs to play their turn 
							at the same time, and then play all the NPC's turn at the same time. Group initiative makes cooperation easier 
							for groups who prefer it, and may speed up combat in online text-only campaigns, while individual initiative 
							tends to make for cleaner combat if players like to lean heavily into roleplay, as well as for high level groups.
							This is a matter of preference and will be discussed during the <a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick=
							"scrolltoSection('Session-Zero')">Session Zero</a> before the campaign starts.</p>

					<h3 id="Movement">Movement</h3>
						<p>At Lv1, each player has 5 m of Movement per turn.</p>
						<p>Unless otherwise specified, <b>HammRPG considers 1 tile on a given battlemap to be 1 meter (m) by 1 m</b> 
							in size, for simplicity. However, additional Movement can be purchased with BP or SP, as outlined in the 
							<a href="./creation.html">Character Creation Guide</a> and the <a href="./abilities.html">Ability Creation 
								Guide</a></p>

					<h3 id="Actions">Actions</h3>
						<p>An Action is a basic activity that a player performs. Swinging a sword at an enemy is one of the simplest 
							examples of this, but there are several basic Actions that every character can perform even without 
							purchasing these Actions with BP or SP. Please refer to the <a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick=
							"scrolltoSection('Abilities')">Abilities List</a> for specific descriptions on how your Abilities can be 
							used in a combat encounter.</p>
						<p>By default, each character has 1 Action, and can purchase more with SP or BP. Some GMs also 
							grant additional Actions at certain levels, just to increase the speed of combat encounters and allow players 
							to feel more powerful.</p>

					<h3 id="Reactions">Reactions</h3>
						<p>A Reaction is very similar to an <a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="scrolltoSection('Action')">Action</a>, 
							except that it is something you can do when it is not your turn. The only default Reaction is the <a href=
							"javascript:void(0);" onclick="scrolltoSection('AOO')">Attack of Opportunity</a>.</p>
						<p>By default, each character has 1 Reaction, and can purchase more with SP or BP.</p>
				
					<h3 id="Melee-Attack">Melee Attack Action</h3>
						<p>The attack Action is the most basic Action in combat encounters. You can either just use your hands 
							or feet or you can use an equipped weapon. Your specific selection of possible attack Actions will depend 
							on the skills and items your PC has available. All melee attack Actions are rolled with a 1d20, plus any 
							bonuses from your character's proficiencies, or the weapon's own modifiers, where the final result 
							represents the attack roll (atk).</p>
						<div class="Highlight">
							<h2>atk = 1d20 + Proficiencies + Weapon Modifiers</h2>
						</div>
						<p>The result of atk is then compared to the target's DV; If atk is equal to or higher than the DV, the 
							attack is successful, and you move on to the damage calculations, which will be explained in detail further 
							below, or apply the appropriate effects. The type and number of dice to use for the dmg roll depends on 
							what attack Action you performed.</p>
						<p>For instance, an unarmed attack uses the unarmed proficiency for atk and a 1d4 damage die. If this is 
							a melee attack, it also benefits from the MD modifier. Similarly, a Steel Shortsword uses sword proficiency, 
							but it also provides a bonus of +1 for atk due to its own design, as well as a 1d6+MD for dmg.</p>
						<p>The <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1QkFdJyOYmSCuLDvVvT-ryOK-unPjXyxaJk77vcSobVA/edit?usp=
							sharing">Armory</a> contains a list of commonly available items with their roll modifiers and other 
							important stats.</p>

						<h4 id="Melee-Failure">Melee Attack Failure:</h4>
							<p>There are no special considerations, as the attack likely just swings through the air. Some GMs like 
								to apply immersive consequences on a nat1 (hit yourself, hit a nearby ally, drop your weapon, etc.), 
								but this is optional and should be discussed during the <a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick=
								"scrolltoSection('Session-Zero')">Session Zero</a> for your game.</p>
					
					<h3 id="Damage-Calculation">Damage Calculation</h3>
							<p>If an attack successfully hits the target, the next step is to determine how hard the hit lands. The 
								Damage Roll (dmg) dice are usually determined by the specific weapons being used. A default unarmed attack 
								uses 1d4 dice, while a particularly good weapon may have 2d12 or even larger dice. Additionally, some 
								weapons provide intrinsic modifiers to the damage dice as well, as detailed in either the <a href="https:
								//docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1QkFdJyOYmSCuLDvVvT-ryOK-unPjXyxaJk77vcSobVA/edit?usp=sharing">Armory</a> 
								or the item's specific stats.</p>
							<p>All melee attacks also benefit from the MD modifier, which is based on the character's Strength, as 
								well as MD proficiency:</p>
							<div class="Highlight Side-by-Side">
								<article>
									<p>Melee Attack:</p>
									<h2>dmg = XdX + Item Modifiers + MD</h2>
								</article>
								<article>
									<p>Ranged Attack</p>
									<h2>dmg = XdX + Item Modifiers</h2>
								</article>
							</div>
							<p>However, different people experience pain differently, and an unarmored character will suffer much more 
								than one in heavy plate armor. This concept is represented by the character's PR and MR stats. As such, 
								we need to determine if the attack was physical or magical in nature, and the subtract the appropriate 
								modifer from the dmg:</p>
							<div class="Highlight Side-by-Side">
								<article>
									<p>Physical dmg:</p>
									<h2>actual HP loss = dmg - PR</h2>
								</article>
								<article>
									<p>Magical dmg</p>
									<h2>actual HP loss = dmg - MR</h2>
								</article>
							</div>
							<p>Note that these modifiers can never reduce your actual HP loss below 1. If an attack hits you, but the dmg 
								is lower than your PR/MR, you will always suffer at least 1 point of HP loss.</p>

					<h3 id="Ranged-Attack">Ranged Attack Action</h3>
						<p>If you cammot reach your enemy, you can still try to attack them by throwing objects (rocks, bottles, 
							alchemical flasks, chairs, etc.), or using ranged weapons such as bows, crossbows, guns, etc. The damage 
							calculation for ranged weapons is idential to the <a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="scrolltoSection(
							'Damage-Calculation')">Damage Calculation</a> for melee weapons, except that ranged weapons do not by default 
							benefit from the MD modifier.</p>
						<p>One important thing to keep in mind with virtually all ranged weapons, is ammunition; you can only 
							shoot an arrow if you actually have an arrow to shoot. Some improvised items, such as rocks, might be 
							available in your surroundings, or you can carry such ammunition with you in your inventory. It is up to you, 
							the player, to ensure that you keep track of ammunition for your PC.</p>
						<p>Additionally, characters can use <a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="scrolltoSection('Cover')">
							Cover</a> to help avoid ranged attacks</p>

						<h4 id="Ranged-Weapon">Ranged Weapon Attacks</h4>
							<p>Most specialized ranged attack tools have their own unique effective ranges. For example, when using a 
								shortbow from the <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1QkFdJyOYmSCuLDvVvT-ryOK-unPjXyxaJk77
								vcSobVA/edit?usp=sharing">Armory</a>, we can see that the standard range is 40 m, while the maximum 
								range is up to 400 m. This means that, when attacking a target that is within 40 m of our character, we 
								simply roll atk with proficiencies. However, if the target is in the long range, we must roll atk with 
								disadvantage, which scales based on the standard range.</p>
							<p>In our example above, this means that for every 40 m, we need to consider an additional instance of 
								disadvantage. Up to 40 m we roll a single die (no disadvantage), between 40 m and 80 m we roll two dice 
								and take the lower result (disadvantage), between 80 m and 120 m we roll three dice and take the lowest 
								result (double disadvantage), then between 120 m and 160 m we roll 4 dice and take the lowest result 
								(triple disadvantage), etc.</p>
							<p>The maximum range indicates the absoulte maximum at which a shot can be attempted, although in many 
								instances, it is probably not practical to actually try to make a shot at that range due to the scaling 
								disadvantage consideration.</p>
							<div class="Highlight Side-by-Side">
								<article>
									<p>Standard Range</p>
									<h2>Single atk roll + proficiency modifiers</h2>
								</article>
								<article>
									<p>Long Range</p>
									<h2>+1 instance of disadvantage per multiplier of the standard range number</h2>
								</article>
							</div>

						<h4 id="Ranged-Throwing">Ranged Throwing Attacks</h4>
							<p>Throwing, on the other hand, is more a feature of the skill of the thrower, as there is no tool being 
								used. As such, throwing is handled through a combined atk/ability roll - in other words, an atk roll 
								that also benefits from the ability modifier:</p>
							<div class="Highlight Side-by-Side">
								<article>
									<p>When throwing for impact damage:<br>(e.g.: rock or spear throw)</p>
									<h2>Athletics roll, where DC = range</h2>
								</article>
								<article>
									<p>When throwing for targeting precision:<br>(e.g.: poison flask, distracting noise)</p>
									<h2>Acrobatics roll, where DC = range</h2>
								</article>
							</div>
							<p>As such throwing does not have an inherent maximum range, but rather your character's skills determine 
								how far they can realistically throw. A beneficial side effect of this method is that both your Throwing 
								proficiency and your Athletics or Acrobatics proficiency applies, which makes throwing a potentially very 
								powerful combat method at early levels.</p>
							<p>Regardless of the range of a throw though, the target's DV still applies, and a throwing attack will miss 
								if it is lower than the target's DV, even if it is higher than the DC needed for the throw.</p>

						<h4 id="Ranged-Failure">Ranged Failure Handling</h4>
							<p>When a melee attack fails, it most likely simply swings through the air, which we can easily ignore. 
								However, once a ranged projectile has been fired or thrown, it might still hit something else, even 
								if it misses its intended target. Particularly, projectiles that deal area damage, such as flasks 
								of poison that shatter on impact and release a poison cloud, or exploding artillery shells, are 
								important in this context.</p>
							<p>We can therefore have to consider targeting accuracy when a ranged attack fails. If the attack misses: </p>
							<div class="Highlight Side-by-Side">
								<article>
									<p>For ranged <u>weapon</u> attacks:</p>
									<h2>Offset = (range to target / default range ) * ( DV - atk )</h2>
								</article>
								<article>
									<p>For ranged <u>throw</u> attacks:</p>
									<h2>Offset = DC - atk</h2>
								</article>
							</div>
							<p>You can then roll a 1d8 to determine in which direction the projectlie missed. A 1 would mean the 
								projectile lands north of the target, 2 northeast, 3 east, etc.</p>
							<p>Note that this system is rather complicated, and it is entirely reasonable to simply have the GM make an 
								on the spot ruling on where the projectile landed based on how bad the atk roll was. For non-area damage 
								or effect causing ranged attacks, a miss can simply be a miss without figuring out where else the 
								projectile goes.</p>

						<h4 id="Cover">Cover</h4>
							<p>Another optional system for ranged weapons is the effect blocking projectiles by utilizing cover.</p>
							<p>Different blocking objects provide different levels of protection:</p>
							<ul>
								<li>Light Cover (heavy foliage, picket fence, light post, etc.): +2 DV</li>
								<li>Medium Cover (wooden wall, storage crates, etc.): +5 DV</li>
								<li>Heavy Cover (stone wall, metal plate objects, etc.): +10 to DV</li>
								<li>Complete Cover: Ranged attacks are not possible</li>
							</ul>
							<p>Note that peeking out from cover, for example in order to make a ranged attack yourself, reduces the 
								effect of whatever cover you are using by 50%. Additionally, it is not possible to peek out from 
								complete cover.</p>
